> Most behavioral detectors of malware remain specific to a given language and platform, mostly PE executables for Windows. The objective of this paper is to define a generic approach for behavioral detection based on two layers respectively responsible for abstraction and detection. The first abstraction layer remains specific to a platform and a language. This first layer interprets the collected instructions, API calls and arguments and classifies these operations as well as the involved objects according to their purpose in the malware lifecycle. The second detection layer remains generic and is totally interoperable between the different abstraction components. This layer relies on parallel automata parsing attribute-grammars where semantic rules are used for object typing (object classification) and object binding (data-flow). To feed detection and to experiment with our approach we have developed two different abstraction components: one processing system call traces from native code and one processing the VBScript interpreted language. The different experimentations have provided promising detection rates, in particular for script files (89%), with almost none false positives. In the case of process traces, the detection rate remains significant (51%) but could be increased by more sophisticated collection tools.

<summary>2009-04-20 09:08:26 - Formalization of malware through process calculi</summary>

> Since the seminal work from F. Cohen in the eighties, abstract virology has seen the apparition of successive viral models, all based on Turing-equivalent formalisms. But considering recent malware such as rootkits or k-ary codes, these viral models only partially cover these evolved threats. The problem is that Turing-equivalent models do not support interactive computations. New models have thus appeared, offering support for these evolved malware, but loosing the unified approach in the way. This article provides a basis for a unified malware model founded on process algebras and in particular the Join-Calculus. In terms of expressiveness, the new model supports the fundamental definitions based on self-replication and adds support for interactions, concurrency and non-termination allows the definition of more complex behaviors. Evolved malware such as rootkits can now be thoroughly modeled. In terms of detection and prevention, the fundamental results of undecidability and isolation still hold. However the process-based model has permitted to establish new results: identification of fragments from the Join-Calculus where malware detection becomes decidable, formal definition of the non-infection property, approximate solutions to restrict malware propagation.

<summary>2009-05-28 09:08:17 - Generic Unpacking of Self-modifying, Aggressive, Packed Binary Programs</summary>

- `0905.4581v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.4581v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.4581v1)

> Nowadays most of the malware applications are either packed or protected. This techniques are applied especially to evade signature based detectors and also to complicate the job of reverse engineers or security analysts. The time one must spend on unpacking or decrypting malware layers is often very long and in fact remains the most complicated task in the overall process of malware analysis. In this report author proposes MmmBop as a relatively new concept of using dynamic binary instrumentation techniques for unpacking and bypassing detection by self-modifying and highly aggressive packed binary code. MmmBop is able to deal with most of the known and unknown packing algorithms and it is also suitable to successfully bypass most of currently used anti-reversing tricks. This framework does not depend on any other 3rd party software and it is developed entirely in user mode (ring3). MmmBop supports the IA-32 architecture and it is targeted for Microsoft Windows XP, some of the further deliberations will be referring directly to this operating system.

<summary>2009-09-24 18:47:17 - SQL/JavaScript Hybrid Worms As Two-stage Quines</summary>

- *JosÃ© I. Orlicki*

- `0909.4516v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4516v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.4516v1)

> Delving into present trends and anticipating future malware trends, a hybrid, SQL on the server-side, JavaScript on the client-side, self-replicating worm based on two-stage quines was designed and implemented on an ad-hoc scenario instantiating a very common software pattern. The proof of concept code combines techniques seen in the wild, in the form of SQL injections leading to cross-site scripting JavaScript inclusion, and seen in the laboratory, in the form of SQL quines propa- gated via RFIDs, resulting in a hybrid code injection. General features of hybrid worms are also discussed.

> Malware is a type of malicious program that replicate from host machine and propagate through network. It has been considered as one type of computer attack and intrusion that can do a variety of malicious activity on a computer. This paper addresses the current trend of malware detection techniques and identifies the significant criteria in each technique to improve malware detection in Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Several existing techniques are analyzing from 48 various researches and the capability criteria of malware detection technique have been reviewed. From the analysis, a new generic taxonomy of malware detection technique have been proposed named Hybrid Malware Detection Technique (Hybrid MDT) which consists of Hybrid Signature and Anomaly detection technique and Hybrid Specification based and Anomaly detection technique to complement the weaknesses of the existing malware detection technique in detecting known and unknown attack as well as reducing false alert before and during the intrusion occur.

<summary>2009-11-12 03:13:37 - A Robust Control Framework for Malware Filtering</summary>

- *Michael Bloem, Tansu Alpcan, Tamer Basar*

- `0911.2293v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2293v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.2293v1)

> We study and develop a robust control framework for malware filtering and network security. We investigate the malware filtering problem by capturing the tradeoff between increased security on one hand and continued usability of the network on the other. We analyze the problem using a linear control system model with a quadratic cost structure and develop algorithms based on H infinity-optimal control theory. A dynamic feedback filter is derived and shown via numerical analysis to be an improvement over various heuristic approaches to malware filtering. The results are verified and demonstrated with packet level simulations on the Ns-2 network simulator.

<summary>2009-12-11 17:41:30 - Detection and Prevention of New and Unknown Malware using Honeypots</summary>

- *Shishir Kumar, Durgesh Pant*

- `0912.2293v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2293v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.2293v1)

> Security has become ubiquitous in every domain today as newly emerging malware pose an ever-increasing perilous threat to systems. Consequently, honeypots are fast emerging as an indispensible forensic tool for the analysis of malicious network traffic. Honeypots can be considered to be traps for hackers and intruders and are generally deployed complimentary to Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) in a network. They help system administrators perform a rigorous analysis of external and internal attacks on their networks. They are also used by security firms and research labs to capture the latest variants of malware. However, honeypots would serve a slightly different purpose in our proposed system. We intend to use honeypots for generating and broadcasting instant cures for new and unknown malware in a network. The cures which will be in the form of on-the-fly anti-malware signatures would spread in a fashion that is similar to the way malware spreads across networks. The most striking advantage of implementing this technology is that an effective initial control can be exercised on malware. Proposed system would be capable of providing cures for new fatal viruses which have not yet been discovered by prime security firms of the world.

> Google's Android is a comprehensive software framework for mobile communication devices (i.e., smartphones, PDAs). The Android framework includes an operating system, middleware and a set of key applications. The incorporation of integrated access services to the Internet on such mobile devices, however, increases their exposure to damages inflicted by various types of malware. This paper provides a comprehensive security assessment of the Android framework and the security mechanisms incorporated into it. A methodological qualitative risk analysis that we conducted identifies the high-risk threats to the framework and any potential danger to information or to the system resulting from vulnerabilities that have been uncovered and exploited. Our review of current academic and commercial solutions in the area of smartphone security yields a list of applied and recommended defense mechanisms for hardening mobile devices in general and the Android in particular. Lastly, we present five major (high-risk) threats to the Android framework and propose security solutions to mitigate them. We conclude by proposing a set of security mechanisms that should be explored and introduced into Android-powered devices.
