<summary>2020-01-10 19:38:58 - Understanding and Mitigating the Security Risks of Content Inclusion in Web Browsers</summary>

- *Sajjad Arshad*

- `2001.03643v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03643v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.03643v1)

> Thanks to the wide range of features offered by web browsers, modern websites include various types of content such as JavaScript and CSS in order to create interactive user interfaces. Browser vendors also provided extensions to enhance web browsers with additional useful capabilities that are not necessarily maintained or supported by default.   However, included content can introduce security risks to users of these websites, unbeknownst to both website operators and users. In addition, the browser's interpretation of the resource URLs may be very different from how the web server resolves the URL to determine which resource should be returned to the browser. The URL may not correspond to an actual server-side file system structure at all, or the web server may internally rewrite parts of the URL. This semantic disconnect between web browsers and web servers in interpreting relative paths (path confusion) could be exploited by Relative Path Overwrite (RPO). On the other hand, even tough extensions provide useful additional functionality for web browsers, they are also an increasingly popular vector for attacks. Due to the high degree of privilege extensions can hold, extensions have been abused to inject advertisements into web pages that divert revenue from content publishers and potentially expose users to malware.   In this thesis, I propose novel research into understanding and mitigating the security risks of content inclusion in web browsers to protect website publishers as well as their users.

- `2001.06309v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06309v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06309v1)

> Cybersecurity attacks are growing both in frequency and sophistication over the years. This increasing sophistication and complexity call for more advancement and continuous innovation in defensive strategies. Traditional methods of intrusion detection and deep packet inspection, while still largely used and recommended, are no longer sufficient to meet the demands of growing security threats. As computing power increases and cost drops, Machine Learning is seen as an alternative method or an additional mechanism to defend against malwares, botnets, and other attacks. This paper explores Machine Learning as a viable solution by examining its capabilities to classify malicious traffic in a network.   First, a strong data analysis is performed resulting in 22 extracted features from the initial Netflow datasets. All these features are then compared with one another through a feature selection process. Then, our approach analyzes five different machine learning algorithms against NetFlow dataset containing common botnets. The Random Forest Classifier succeeds in detecting more than 95% of the botnets in 8 out of 13 scenarios and more than 55% in the most difficult datasets. Finally, insight is given to improve and generalize the results, especially through a bootstrapping technique.

<summary>2020-01-18 18:50:40 - Comment on "AndrODet: An adaptive Android obfuscation detector"</summary>

- *Alireza Mohammadinodooshan, Ulf KargÃ©n, Nahid Shahmehri*

- `1910.06192v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06192v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.06192v2)

> We have identified a methodological problem in the empirical evaluation of the string encryption detection capabilities of the AndrODet system described by Mirzaei et al. in the recent paper "AndrODet: An adaptive Android obfuscation detector". The accuracy of string encryption detection is evaluated using samples from the AMD and PraGuard malware datasets. However, the authors failed to account for the fact that many of the AMD samples are highly similar due to the fact that they come from the same malware family. This introduces a risk that a machine learning system trained on these samples could fail to learn a generalizable model for string encryption detection, and might instead learn to classify samples based on characteristics of each malware family. Our own evaluation strongly indicates that the reported high accuracy of AndrODet's string encryption detection is indeed due to this phenomenon. When we evaluated AndrODet, we found that when we ensured that samples from the same family never appeared in both training and testing data, the accuracy dropped to around 50%. Moreover, the PraGuard dataset is not suitable for evaluating a static string encryption detector such as AndrODet, since the particular obfuscation tool used to produce the dataset effectively makes it impossible to extract meaningful features of static strings in Android apps.

<summary>2020-01-20 16:08:47 - On the Feasibility of Acoustic Attacks Using Commodity Smart Devices</summary>

- *Matt Wixey, Shane Johnson, Emiliano De Cristofaro*

- `2001.07157v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07157v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07157v1)

> Sound at frequencies above (ultrasonic) or below (infrasonic) the range of human hearing can, in some settings, cause adverse physiological and psychological effects to individuals. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of cyber-attacks that could make smart consumer devices produce possibly imperceptible sound at both high (17-21kHz) and low (60-100Hz) frequencies, at the maximum available volume setting, potentially turning them into acoustic cyber-weapons. To do so, we deploy attacks targeting different smart devices and take sound measurements in an anechoic chamber. For comparison, we also test possible attacks on traditional devices.   Overall, we find that many of the devices tested are capable of reproducing frequencies within both high and low ranges, at levels exceeding those recommended in published guidelines. Generally speaking, such attacks are often trivial to develop and in many cases could be added to existing malware payloads, as they may be attractive to adversaries with specific motivations or targets. Finally, we suggest a number of countermeasures, both platform-specific and generic ones.

> Nowadays security is major concern for any user connected to the internet. Various types of attacks are to be performed by intruders to obtaining user information as manin-middle attack, denial of service, malware attacks etc. Malware attacks specifically ransomware attack become very famous recently. Ransomware attack threaten the users by encrypting their most valuable data, lock the user screen, play some random videos and by various more means. Finally attacker take benefits by users through paid ransom. In this paper, we propose a framework which prevent the ransomware attack more appropriately using various techniques as blockchain, honeypot, cloud & edge computing. This framework is analysed mainly through the IoT devices and generalized to the any malware attack.

- *Felipe N. Ducau, Ethan M. Rudd, Tad M. Heppner, Alex Long, Konstantin Berlin*

- `1905.06262v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06262v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06262v3)

> With the rapid proliferation and increased sophistication of malicious software (malware), detection methods no longer rely only on manually generated signatures but have also incorporated more general approaches like machine learning detection. Although powerful for conviction of malicious artifacts, these methods do not produce any further information about the type of threat that has been detected neither allows for identifying relationships between malware samples. In this work, we address the information gap between machine learning and signature-based detection methods by learning a representation space for malware samples in which files with similar malicious behaviors appear close to each other. We do so by introducing a deep learning based tagging model trained to generate human-interpretable semantic descriptions of malicious software, which, at the same time provides potentially more useful and flexible information than malware family names.   We show that the malware descriptions generated with the proposed approach correctly identify more than 95% of eleven possible tag descriptions for a given sample, at a deployable false positive rate of 1% per tag. Furthermore, we use the learned representation space to introduce a similarity index between malware files, and empirically demonstrate using dynamic traces from files' execution, that is not only more effective at identifying samples from the same families, but also 32 times smaller than those based on raw feature vectors.

> Modern malware can take various forms, and has reached a very high level of sophistication in terms of its penetration, persistence, communication and hiding capabilities. The use of cryptography, and of covert communication channels over public and widely used protocols and services, is becoming a norm. In this work, we start by introducing Resource Identifier Generation Algorithms. These are an extension of a well-known mechanism called Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA), which are frequently employed by cybercriminals for bot management and communication. Our extension allows, beyond DNS, the use of other protocols. More concretely, we showcase the exploitation of the InterPlanetary file system (IPFS). This is a solution for the "permanent web", which enjoys a steadily growing community interest and adoption. The IPFS is, in addition, one of the most prominent solutions for blockchain storage. We go beyond the straightforward case of using the IPFS for hosting malicious content, and explore ways in which a botmaster could employ it, to manage her bots, validating our findings experimentally. Finally, we discuss the advantages of our approach for malware authors, its efficacy and highlight its extensibility for other distributed storage services.

<summary>2020-01-24 02:36:00 - Dynamic Malware Analysis with Feature Engineering and Feature Learning</summary>

- *Zhaoqi Zhang, Panpan Qi, Wei Wang*

- `1907.07352v5` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07352v5) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07352v5)

> Dynamic malware analysis executes the program in an isolated environment and monitors its run-time behaviour (e.g. system API calls) for malware detection. This technique has been proven to be effective against various code obfuscation techniques and newly released ("zero-day") malware. However, existing works typically only consider the API name while ignoring the arguments, or require complex feature engineering operations and expert knowledge to process the arguments. In this paper, we propose a novel and low-cost feature extraction approach, and an effective deep neural network architecture for accurate and fast malware detection. Specifically, the feature representation approach utilizes a feature hashing trick to encode the API call arguments associated with the API name. The deep neural network architecture applies multiple Gated-CNNs (convolutional neural networks) to transform the extracted features of each API call. The outputs are further processed through bidirectional LSTM (long-short term memory networks) to learn the sequential correlation among API calls. Experiments show that our solution outperforms baselines significantly on a large real dataset. Valuable insights about feature engineering and architecture design are derived from the ablation study.

> Since the first Graphical User Interface (GUI) prototype was invented in the 1970s, GUI systems have been deployed into various personal computer systems and server platforms. Recently, with the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, malicious malware powered by AI is emerging as a potential threat to GUI systems. This type of AI-based cybersecurity attack, targeting at GUI systems, is explored in this paper. It is twofold: (1) A malware is designed to attack the existing GUI system by using AI-based object recognition techniques. (2) Its defensive methods are discovered by generating adversarial examples and other methods to alleviate the threats from the intelligent GUI attack. The results have shown that a generic GUI attack can be implemented and performed in a simple way based on current AI techniques and its countermeasures are temporary but effective to mitigate the threats of GUI attack so far.

> Nowadays, the usage of smartphones and their applications have become rapidly increasing popular in people's daily life. Over the last decade, availability of mobile money services such as mobile-payment systems and app markets have significantly increased due to the different forms of apps and connectivity provided by mobile devices such as 3G, 4G, GPRS, and Wi-Fi, etc. In the same trend, the number of vulnerabilities targeting these services and communication networks has raised as well. Therefore, smartphones have become ideal target devices for malicious programmers. With increasing the number of vulnerabilities and attacks, there has been a corresponding ascent of the security countermeasures presented by the researchers. Due to these reasons, security of the payment systems is one of the most important issues in mobile payment systems. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive and structured overview of the research on security solutions for smartphone devices. This survey reviews the state of the art on security solutions, threats, and vulnerabilities during the period of 2011-2017, by focusing on software attacks, such those to smartphone applications. We outline some countermeasures aimed at protecting smartphones against these groups of attacks, based on the detection rules, data collections and operating systems, especially focusing on open source applications. With this categorization, we want to provide an easy understanding for users and researchers to improve their knowledge about the security and privacy of smartphones.

- *Ibrahim Yilmaz*

- `2001.09610v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09610v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09610v1)

> Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a topic of major research for many years. Especially, with the emergence of deep neural network (DNN), these studies have been tremendously successful. Today machines are capable of making faster, more accurate decision than human. Thanks to the great development of machine learning (ML) techniques, ML have been used many different fields such as education, medicine, malware detection, autonomous car etc. In spite of having this degree of interest and much successful research, ML models are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Attackers can manipulate clean data in order to fool the ML classifiers to achieve their desire target. For instance; a benign sample can be modified as a malicious sample or a malicious one can be altered as benign while this modification can not be recognized by human observer. This can lead to many financial losses, or serious injuries, even deaths. The motivation behind this paper is that we emphasize this issue and want to raise awareness. Therefore, the security gap of mammographic image classifier against adversarial attack is demonstrated. We use mamographic images to train our model then evaluate our model performance in terms of accuracy. Later on, we poison original dataset and generate adversarial samples that missclassified by the model. We then using structural similarity index (SSIM) analyze similarity between clean images and adversarial images. Finally, we show how successful we are to misuse by using different poisoning factors.

> In cyberattack detection and prevention systems, cybersecurity analysts always prefer solutions that are as interpretable and understandable as rule-based or signature-based detection. This is because of the need to tune and optimize these solutions to mitigate and control the effect of false positives and false negatives. Interpreting machine learning models is a new and open challenge. However, it is expected that an interpretable machine learning solution will be domain-specific. For instance, interpretable solutions for machine learning models in healthcare are different than solutions in malware detection. This is because the models are complex, and most of them work as a black-box. Recently, the increased ability for malware authors to bypass antimalware systems has forced security specialists to look to machine learning for creating robust detection systems. If these systems are to be relied on in the industry, then, among other challenges, they must also explain their predictions. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the current state-of-the-art ML models interpretability techniques when applied to ML-based malware detectors. We demonstrate interpretability techniques in practice and evaluate the effectiveness of existing interpretability techniques in the malware analysis domain.

> Air-gapped computers are systems that are kept isolated from the Internet since they store or process sensitive information.   In this paper, we introduce an optical covert channel in which an attacker can leak (or, exfiltlrate) sensitive information from air-gapped computers through manipulations on the screen brightness. This covert channel is invisible and it works even while the user is working on the computer. Malware on a compromised computer can obtain sensitive data (e.g., files, images, encryption keys and passwords), and modulate it within the screen brightness, invisible to users. The small changes in the brightness are invisible to humans but can be recovered from video streams taken by cameras such as a local security camera, smartphone camera or a webcam. We present related work and discuss the technical and scientific background of this covert channel. We examined the channel's boundaries under various parameters, with different types of computer and TV screens, and at several distances. We also tested different types of camera receivers to demonstrate the covert channel. Lastly, we present relevant countermeasures to this type of attack. Lastly, we present relevant countermeasures to this type of attack.

- `2002.01656v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01656v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.01656v1)

> Advertisement drives the economy of the mobile app ecosystem. As a key component in the mobile ad business model, mobile ad content has been overlooked by the research community, which poses a number of threats, e.g., propagating malware and undesirable contents. To understand the practice of these devious ad behaviors, we perform a large-scale study on the app contents harvested through automated app testing. In this work, we first provide a comprehensive categorization of devious ad contents, including five kinds of behaviors belonging to two categories: \emph{ad loading content} and \emph{ad clicking content}. Then, we propose MadDroid, a framework for automated detection of devious ad contents. MadDroid leverages an automated app testing framework with a sophisticated ad view exploration strategy for effectively collecting ad-related network traffic and subsequently extracting ad contents. We then integrate dedicated approaches into the framework to identify devious ad contents. We have applied MadDroid to 40,000 Android apps and found that roughly 6\% of apps deliver devious ad contents, e.g., distributing malicious apps that cannot be downloaded via traditional app markets. Experiment results indicate that devious ad contents are prevalent, suggesting that our community should invest more effort into the detection and mitigation of devious ads towards building a trustworthy mobile advertising ecosystem.

- *Moshe Kravchik, Asaf Shabtai*

- `2002.02741v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02741v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02741v1)

> In recent years, a variety of effective neural network-based methods for anomaly and cyber attack detection in industrial control systems (ICSs) have been demonstrated in the literature. Given their successful implementation and widespread use, there is a need to study adversarial attacks on such detection methods to better protect the systems that depend upon them. The extensive research performed on adversarial attacks on image and malware classification has little relevance to the physical system state prediction domain, which most of the ICS attack detection systems belong to. Moreover, such detection systems are typically retrained using new data collected from the monitored system, thus the threat of adversarial data poisoning is significant, however this threat has not yet been addressed by the research community. In this paper, we present the first study focused on poisoning attacks on online-trained autoencoder-based attack detectors. We propose two algorithms for generating poison samples, an interpolation-based algorithm and a back-gradient optimization-based algorithm, which we evaluate on both synthetic and real-world ICS data. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can generate poison samples that cause the target attack to go undetected by the autoencoder detector, however the ability to poison the detector is limited to a small set of attack types and magnitudes. When the poison-generating algorithms are applied to the popular SWaT dataset, we show that the autoencoder detector trained on the physical system state data is resilient to poisoning in the face of all ten of the relevant attacks in the dataset. This finding suggests that neural network-based attack detectors used in the cyber-physical domain are more robust to poisoning than in other problem domains, such as malware detection and image processing.

> This paper reports the findings of a study where users (N=220) interacted with Malexa, Alexa's malicious twin. Malexa is an intelligent voice assistant with a simple and seemingly harmless third-party skill that delivers news briefings to users. The twist, however, is that Malexa covertly rewords these briefings to intentionally introduce misperception about the reported events. This covert rewording is referred to as a Malware-Induced Misperception (MIM) attack. It differs from squatting or invocation hijacking attacks in that it is focused on manipulating the "content" delivered through a third-party skill instead of the skill's "invocation logic." Malexa, in the study, reworded regulatory briefings to make a government response sound more accidental or lenient than the original news delivered by Alexa. The results show that users who interacted with Malexa perceived that the government was less friendly to working people and more in favor of big businesses. The results also show that Malexa is capable of inducing misperceptions regardless of the user's gender, political ideology or frequency of interaction with intelligent voice assistants. We discuss the implications in the context of using Malexa as a covert "influencer" in people's living or working environments.

> We consider the problem of detecting malware with deep learning models, where the malware may be combined with significant amounts of benign code. Examples of this include piggybacking and trojan horse attacks on a system, where malicious behavior is hidden within a useful application. Such added flexibility in augmenting the malware enables significantly more code obfuscation. Hence we focus on the use of static features, particularly Intents, Permissions, and API calls, which we presume cannot be ultimately hidden from the Android system, but only augmented with yet more such features. We first train a deep neural network classifier for malware classification using features of benign and malware samples. Then we demonstrate a steep increase in false negative rate (i.e., attacks succeed), simply by randomly adding features of a benign app to malware. Finally we test the use of data augmentation to harden the classifier against such attacks. We find that for API calls, it is possible to reject the vast majority of attacks, where using Intents or Permissions is less successful.

> Android malware detection is a critical step towards building a security credible system. Especially, manual search for the potential malicious code has plagued program analysts for a long time. In this paper, we propose Droidetec, a deep learning based method for android malware detection and malicious code localization, to model an application program as a natural language sequence. Droidetec adopts a novel feature extraction method to derive behavior sequences from Android applications. Based on that, the bi-directional Long Short Term Memory network is utilized for malware detection. Each unit in the extracted behavior sequence is inventively represented as a vector, which allows Droidetec to automatically analyze the semantics of sequence segments and eventually find out the malicious code. Experiments with 9616 malicious and 11982 benign programs show that Droidetec reaches an accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 98.21%. In all, Droidetec has a hit rate of 91% to properly find out malicious code segments.

> Social media trolling is a powerful tactic to manipulate public opinion on issues with a high moral component. Troll farms, as evidenced in the past, created fabricated content to provoke or silence people to share their opinion on social media during the US presidential election in 2016. In this paper, we introduce an alternate way of provoking or silencing social media discourse by manipulating how users perceive authentic content. This manipulation is performed by man-in-the-middle malware that covertly rearranges the linguistic content of an authentic social media post and comments. We call this attack Malware-Induced Misperception (MIM) because the goal is to socially engineer spiral-of-silence conditions on social media by inducing perception. We conducted experimental tests in controlled settings (N = 311) where a malware covertly altered selected words in a Facebook post about the freedom of political expression on college campuses. The empirical results (1) confirm the previous findings about the presence of the spiral-of-silence effect on social media; and (2) demonstrate that inducing misperception is an effective tactic to silence or provoke targeted users on Facebook to express their opinion on a polarizing political issue.

> In many interesting cases, the application of machine learning is hindered by data having a complicated structure stimulated by a structured file-formats like JSONs, XMLs, or ProtoBuffers, which is non-trivial to convert to a vector / matrix. Moreover, since the structure frequently carries a semantic meaning, reflecting it in the machine learning model should improve the accuracy but more importantly it facilitates the explanation of decisions and the model. This paper demonstrates on the identification of infected computers in the computer network from their HTTP traffic, how to achieve this reflection using recent progress in multiple-instance learning. The proposed model is compared to complementary approaches from the prior art, the first relying on human-designed features and the second on automatically learned features through convolution neural networks. In a challenging scenario measuring accuracy only on unseen domains/malware families, the proposed model is superior to the prior art while providing a valuable feedback to the security researchers. We believe that the proposed framework will found applications elsewhere even beyond the field of security.

> Extensions provide useful additional functionality for web browsers, but are also an increasingly popular vector for attacks. Due to the high degree of privilege extensions can hold, extensions have been abused to inject advertisements into web pages that divert revenue from content publishers and potentially expose users to malware. Users are often unaware of such practices, believing the modifications to the page originate from publishers. Additionally, automated identification of unwanted third-party modifications is fundamentally difficult, as users are the ultimate arbiters of whether content is undesired in the absence of outright malice.   To resolve this dilemma, we present a fine-grained approach to tracking the provenance of web content at the level of individual DOM elements. In conjunction with visual indicators, provenance information can be used to reliably determine the source of content modifications, distinguishing publisher content from content that originates from third parties such as extensions. We describe a prototype implementation of the approach called OriginTracer for Chromium, and evaluate its effectiveness, usability, and performance overhead through a user study and automated experiments. The results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the ability of users to identify unwanted third-party content such as injected ads with modest performance overhead.

> Modern websites include various types of third-party content such as JavaScript, images, stylesheets, and Flash objects in order to create interactive user interfaces. In addition to explicit inclusion of third-party content by website publishers, ISPs and browser extensions are hijacking web browsing sessions with increasing frequency to inject third-party content (e.g., ads). However, third-party content can also introduce security risks to users of these websites, unbeknownst to both website operators and users. Because of the often highly dynamic nature of these inclusions as well as the use of advanced cloaking techniques in contemporary malware, it is exceedingly difficult to preemptively recognize and block inclusions of malicious third-party content before it has the chance to attack the user's system. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to achieving the goal of preemptive blocking of malicious third-party content inclusion through an analysis of inclusion sequences on the Web. We implemented our approach, called Excision, as a set of modifications to the Chromium browser that protects users from malicious inclusions while web pages load. Our analysis suggests that by adopting our in-browser approach, users can avoid a significant portion of malicious third-party content on the Web. Our evaluation shows that Excision effectively identifies malicious content while introducing a low false positive rate. Our experiments also demonstrate that our approach does not negatively impact a user's browsing experience when browsing popular websites drawn from the Alexa Top 500.

> Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are frequently used to generate numerous domains for use by botnets. These domains are often utilized as rendezvous points for servers that malware has command and control over. There are many algorithms that are used to generate domains, however many of these algorithms are simplistic and easily detected by traditional machine learning techniques. In this paper, three variants of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are optimized to generate domains which have similar characteristics of benign domains, resulting in domains which greatly evade several state-of-the-art deep learning based DGA classifiers. We additionally provide a detailed analysis into offensive usability for each variant with respect to repeated and existing domain collisions. Finally, we fine-tune the state-of-the-art DGA classifiers by adding GAN generated samples to their original training datasets and analyze the changes in performance. Our results conclude that GAN based DGAs are superior in evading DGA classifiers in comparison to traditional DGAs, and of the variants, the Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGANGP) is the highest performing DGA for uses both offensively and defensively.

> Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is vulnerable to malware due to its exposure to external adversaries, making it a lucrative attack vector for malicious actors. A datacenter infected with malware can cause data loss and/or major disruptions to service for its users. This paper analyzes and compares various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for online detection of malware in cloud IaaS. The detection is performed based on behavioural data using process level performance metrics including cpu usage, memory usage, disk usage etc. We have used the state of the art DenseNets and ResNets in effectively detecting malware in online cloud system. CNN are designed to extract features from data gathered from a live malware running on a real cloud environment. Experiments are performed on OpenStack (a cloud IaaS software) testbed designed to replicate a typical 3-tier web architecture. Comparative analysis is performed for different metrics for different CNN models used in this research.

> Count distinct or cardinality estimates are widely used in network monitoring for security. They can be used, for example, to detect the malware spread, network scans, or a denial of service attack. There are many algorithms to estimate cardinality. Among those, HyperLogLog (HLL) has been one of the most widely adopted. HLL is simple, provides good cardinality estimates over a wide range of values, requires a small amount of memory, and allows merging of estimates from different sources. However, as HLL is increasingly used to detect attacks, it can itself become the target of attackers that want to avoid being detected. To the best of our knowledge, the security of HLL has not been studied before. In this letter, we take an initial step in its study by first exposing a vulnerability of HLL that allows an attacker to manipulate its estimate. This shows the importance of designing secure HLL implementations. In the second part of the letter, we propose an efficient protection technique to detect and avoid the HLL manipulation. The results presented strongly suggest that the security of HLL should be further studied given that it is widely adopted in many networking and computing applications.

> On-device machine learning (ML) is quickly gaining popularity among mobile apps. It allows offline model inference while preserving user privacy. However, ML models, considered as core intellectual properties of model owners, are now stored on billions of untrusted devices and subject to potential thefts. Leaked models can cause both severe financial loss and security consequences.   This paper presents the first empirical study of ML model protection on mobile devices. Our study aims to answer three open questions with quantitative evidence: How widely is model protection used in apps? How robust are existing model protection techniques? How much can (stolen) models cost? To that end, we built a simple app analysis pipeline and analyzed 46,753 popular apps collected from the US and Chinese app markets. We identified 1,468 ML apps spanning all popular app categories. We found that, alarmingly, 41% of ML apps do not protect their models at all, which can be trivially stolen from app packages. Even for those apps that use model protection or encryption, we were able to extract the models from 66% of them via unsophisticated dynamic analysis techniques. The extracted models are mostly commercial products and used for face recognition, liveness detection, ID/bank card recognition, and malware detection. We quantitatively estimated the potential financial impact of a leaked model, which can amount to millions of dollars for different stakeholders.   Our study reveals that on-device models are currently at high risk of being leaked; attackers are highly motivated to steal such models. Drawn from our large-scale study, we report our insights into this emerging security problem and discuss the technical challenges, hoping to inspire future research on robust and practical model protection for mobile devices.

> Designing effective defense against adversarial attacks is a crucial topic as deep neural networks have been proliferated rapidly in many security-critical domains such as malware detection and self-driving cars. Conventional defense methods, although shown to be promising, are largely limited by their single-source single-cost nature: The robustness promotion tends to plateau when the defenses are made increasingly stronger while the cost tends to amplify. In this paper, we study principles of designing multi-source and multi-cost schemes where defense performance is boosted from multiple defending components. Based on this motivation, we propose a multi-source and multi-cost defense scheme, Adversarially Trained Model Switching (AdvMS), that inherits advantages from two leading schemes: adversarial training and random model switching. We show that the multi-source nature of AdvMS mitigates the performance plateauing issue and the multi-cost nature enables improving robustness at a flexible and adjustable combination of costs over different factors which can better suit specific restrictions and needs in practice.

> Detecting the Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) between two input graphs is fundamental for applications in biomedical analysis, malware detection, cloud computing, etc. This is especially important in the task of drug design, where the successful extraction of common substructures in compounds can reduce the number of experiments needed to be conducted by humans. However, MCS computation is NP-hard, and state-of-the-art exact MCS solvers do not have worst-case time complexity guarantee and cannot handle large graphs in practice. Designing learning based models to find the MCS between two graphs in an approximate yet accurate way while utilizing as few labeled MCS instances as possible remains to be a challenging task. Here we propose RLMCS, a Graph Neural Network based model for MCS detection through reinforcement learning. Our model uses an exploration tree to extract subgraphs in two graphs one node pair at a time, and is trained to optimize subgraph extraction rewards via Deep Q-Networks. A novel graph embedding method is proposed to generate state representations for nodes and extracted subgraphs jointly at each step. Experiments on real graph datasets demonstrate that our model performs favorably to exact MCS solvers and supervised neural graph matching network models in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

> Social engineers attempt to manipulate users into undertaking actions such as downloading malware by clicking links or providing access to money or sensitive information. Natural language processing, computational sociolinguistics, and media-specific structural clues provide a means for detecting both the ask (e.g., buy gift card) and the risk/reward implied by the ask, which we call framing (e.g., lose your job, get a raise). We apply linguistic resources such as Lexical Conceptual Structure to tackle ask detection and also leverage structural clues such as links and their proximity to identified asks to improve confidence in our results. Our experiments indicate that the performance of ask detection, framing detection, and identification of the top ask is improved by linguistically motivated classes coupled with structural clues such as links. Our approach is implemented in a system that informs users about social engineering risk situations.

> The widespread adoption of smartphones dramatically increases the risk of attacks and the spread of mobile malware, especially on the Android platform. Machine learning-based solutions have been already used as a tool to supersede signature-based anti-malware systems. However, malware authors leverage features from malicious and legitimate samples to estimate statistical difference in-order to create adversarial examples. Hence, to evaluate the vulnerability of machine learning algorithms in malware detection, we propose five different attack scenarios to perturb malicious applications (apps). By doing this, the classification algorithm inappropriately fits the discriminant function on the set of data points, eventually yielding a higher misclassification rate. Further, to distinguish the adversarial examples from benign samples, we propose two defense mechanisms to counter attacks. To validate our attacks and solutions, we test our model on three different benchmark datasets. We also test our methods using various classifier algorithms and compare them with the state-of-the-art data poisoning method using the Jacobian matrix. Promising results show that generated adversarial samples can evade detection with a very high probability. Additionally, evasive variants generated by our attack models when used to harden the developed anti-malware system improves the detection rate up to 50% when using the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) method.

> In this paper, we introduce Anomaly Contribution Explainer or ACE, a tool to explain security anomaly detection models in terms of the model features through a regression framework, and its variant, ACE-KL, which highlights the important anomaly contributors. ACE and ACE-KL provide insights in diagnosing which attributes significantly contribute to an anomaly by building a specialized linear model to locally approximate the anomaly score that a black-box model generates. We conducted experiments with these anomaly detection models to detect security anomalies on both synthetic data and real data. In particular, we evaluate performance on three public data sets: CERT insider threat, netflow logs, and Android malware. The experimental results are encouraging: our methods consistently identify the correct contributing feature in the synthetic data where ground truth is available; similarly, for real data sets, our methods point a security analyst in the direction of the underlying causes of an anomaly, including in one case leading to the discovery of previously overlooked network scanning activity. We have made our source code publicly available.

> Network intrusion detection systems and antivirus software are essential in detecting malicious network traffic and attacks such as denial-of-service and malwares. Each attack, worm or virus has its own distinctive signature. Signature-based intrusion detection and antivirus systems depend on pattern matching to look for possible attack signatures. Pattern matching is a very complex task, which requires a lot of time, memory and computing resources. Software-based intrusion detection is not fast enough to match high network speeds and the increasing number of attacks. In this paper, we propose special purpose hardware for Wu-Manber pattern matching algorithm. FPGAs form an excellent choice because of their massively parallel structure, reprogrammable logic and memory resources. The hardware is designed in Verilog and implemented using Xilinx ISE. For evaluation, we dope network traffic traces collected using Wireshark with 2500 signatures from the ClamAV virus definitions database. Experimental results show high speed that reaches up to 216 Mbps. In addition, we evaluate time, device usage, and power consumption.

> Recent advances in adversarial attacks have shown that machine learning classifiers based on static analysis are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, real-world antivirus systems do not rely only on static classifiers, thus many of these static evasions get detected by dynamic analysis whenever the malware runs. The real question is to what extent these adversarial attacks are actually harmful to the real users? In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to create and evaluate realistic adversarial malware to evade real-world systems. We propose new adversarial attacks against real-world antivirus systems based on code randomization and binary manipulation, and use our framework to perform the attacks on 1000 malware samples and test four commercial antivirus software and two open-source classifiers. We demonstrate that the static detectors of real-world antivirus can be evaded 24.3%-41.9% of the cases and often by changing only one byte. We also find that the adversarial attacks are transferable between different antivirus up to 16% of the cases. We also tested the efficacy of the complete (i.e. static + dynamic) classifiers in protecting users. While most of the commercial antivirus use their dynamic engines to protect the users' device when the static classifiers are evaded, we are the first to demonstrate that for one commercial antivirus, static evasions can also evade the offline dynamic detectors and infect users' machines. Our framework can also help explain which features are responsible for evasion and thus can help improve the robustness of malware detectors.

> Robust network security systems are essential to prevent and mitigate the harming effects of the ever-growing occurrence of network attacks. In recent years, machine learning-based systems have gain popularity for network security applications, usually considering the application of shallow models, which rely on the careful engineering of expert, handcrafted input features. The main limitation of this approach is that handcrafted features can fail to perform well under different scenarios and types of attacks. Deep Learning (DL) models can solve this limitation using their ability to learn feature representations from raw, non-processed data. In this paper we explore the power of DL models on the specific problem of detection and classification of malware network traffic. As a major advantage with respect to the state of the art, we consider raw measurements coming directly from the stream of monitored bytes as input to the proposed models, and evaluate different raw-traffic feature representations, including packet and flow-level ones. We introduce DeepMAL, a DL model which is able to capture the underlying statistics of malicious traffic, without any sort of expert handcrafted features. Using publicly available traffic traces containing different families of malware traffic, we show that DeepMAL can detect and classify malware flows with high accuracy, outperforming traditional, shallow-like models.

> Malware applications typically use a command and control (C&C) server to manage bots to perform malicious activities. Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are popular methods for generating pseudo-random domain names that can be used to establish a communication between an infected bot and the C&C server. In recent years, machine learning based systems have been widely used to detect DGAs. There are several well known state-of-the-art classifiers in the literature that can detect DGA domain names in real-time applications with high predictive performance. However, these DGA classifiers are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks in which adversaries purposely craft domain names to evade DGA detection classifiers. In our work, we focus on hardening DGA classifiers against adversarial attacks. To this end, we train and evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning and random forest (RF) classifiers for DGA detection using side information that is harder for adversaries to manipulate than the domain name itself. Additionally, the side information features are selected such that they are easily obtainable in practice to perform inline DGA detection. The performance and robustness of these models is assessed by exposing them to one day of real-traffic data as well as domains generated by adversarial attack algorithms. We found that the DGA classifiers that rely on both the domain name and side information have high performance and are more robust against adversaries.

> Recent research efforts on adversarial ML have investigated problem-space attacks, focusing on the generation of real evasive objects in domains where, unlike images, there is no clear inverse mapping to the feature space (e.g., software). However, the design, comparison, and real-world implications of problem-space attacks remain underexplored. This paper makes two major contributions. First, we propose a novel formalization for adversarial ML evasion attacks in the problem-space, which includes the definition of a comprehensive set of constraints on available transformations, preserved semantics, robustness to preprocessing, and plausibility. We shed light on the relationship between feature space and problem space, and we introduce the concept of side-effect features as the byproduct of the inverse feature-mapping problem. This enables us to define and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of problem-space attacks. We further demonstrate the expressive power of our formalization by using it to describe several attacks from related literature across different domains. Second, building on our formalization, we propose a novel problem-space attack on Android malware that overcomes past limitations. Experiments on a dataset with 170K Android apps from 2017 and 2018 show the practical feasibility of evading a state-of-the-art malware classifier along with its hardened version. Our results demonstrate that "adversarial-malware as a service" is a realistic threat, as we automatically generate thousands of realistic and inconspicuous adversarial applications at scale, where on average it takes only a few minutes to generate an adversarial app. Our formalization of problem-space attacks paves the way to more principled research in this domain.

> Over the past three years, especially following WannaCry malware, ransomware has become one of the biggest concerns for private businesses, state, and local government agencies. According to Homeland Security statistics, 1.5 million ransomware attacks have occurred per year since 2016. Cybercriminals often use creative methods to inject their malware into the target machines and use sophisticated cryptographic techniques to hold hostage victims' files and programs unless a certain amount of equivalent Bitcoin is paid. The return to the cybercriminals is so high (estimated \$1 billion in 2019) without any cost because of the advanced anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin \cite{Paquet-Clouston2019}. Given this context, this study first discusses the current state of ransomware, detection, and prevention systems. Second, we propose a global ransomware center to better manage our concerted efforts against cybercriminals. The policy implications of the proposed study are discussed in the conclusion section.

> Despite the growing threat posed by Android malware, the research community is still lacking a comprehensive view of common behaviors and trends exposed by malware families active on the platform. Without such view, the researchers incur the risk of developing systems that only detect outdated threats, missing the most recent ones. In this paper, we conduct the largest measurement of Android malware behavior to date, analyzing over 1.2 million malware samples that belong to 1.2K families over a period of eight years (from 2010 to 2017). We aim at understanding how the behavior of Android malware has evolved over time, focusing on repackaging malware. In this type of threats different innocuous apps are piggybacked with a malicious payload (rider), allowing inexpensive malware manufacturing.   One of the main challenges posed when studying repackaged malware is slicing the app to split benign components apart from the malicious ones. To address this problem, we use differential analysis to isolate software components that are irrelevant to the campaign and study the behavior of malicious riders alone. Our analysis framework relies on collective repositories and recent advances on the systematization of intelligence extracted from multiple anti-virus vendors. We find that since its infancy in 2010, the Android malware ecosystem has changed significantly, both in the type of malicious activity performed by the malicious samples and in the level of obfuscation used by malware to avoid detection. We then show that our framework can aid analysts who attempt to study unknown malware families. Finally, we discuss what our findings mean for Android malware detection research, highlighting areas that need further attention by the research community.

> Trolling and social bots have been proven as powerful tactics for manipulating the public opinion and sowing discord among Twitter users. This effort requires substantial content fabrication and account coordination to evade Twitter's detection of nefarious platform use. In this paper we explore an alternative tactic for covert social media interference by inducing misperceptions about genuine, non-trolling content from verified users. This tactic uses a malware that covertly manipulates targeted words, hashtags, and Twitter metrics before the genuine content is presented to a targeted user in a covert man-in-the-middle fashion. Early tests of the malware found that it is capable of achieving a similar goal as trolls and social bots, that is, silencing or provoking social media users to express their opinion in polarized debates on social media. Following this, we conducted experimental tests in controlled settings (N=315) where the malware covertly manipulated the perception in a Twitter debate on the risk of vaccines causing autism. The empirical results demonstrate that inducing misperception is an effective tactic to silence users on Twitter when debating polarizing issues like vaccines. We used the findings to propose a solution for countering the effect of the malware-induced misperception that could also be used against trolls and social bots on Twitter.

Common DGA detection techniques fail to reliably detect DGA variants that combine random dictionary words to create domain names that closely mirror legitimate domains. To combat this, we created a novel hybrid neural network, Bilbo the `bagging` model, that analyses domains and scores the likelihood they are generated by such algorithms and therefore are potentially malicious. Bilbo is the first parallel usage of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for DGA detection. Our unique architecture is found to be the most consistent in performance in terms of AUC, F1 score, and accuracy when generalising across different dictionary DGA classification tasks compared to current state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. We validate using reverse-engineered dictionary DGA domains and detail our real-time implementation strategy for scoring real-world network logs within a large financial enterprise. In four hours of actual network traffic, the model discovered at least five potential command-and-control networks that commercial vendor tools did not flag.

> Android malware is a persistent threat to billions of users around the world. As a countermeasure, Android malware detection systems are occasionally implemented. However, these systems are often vulnerable to \emph{evasion attacks}, in which an adversary manipulates malicious instances so that they are misidentified as benign. In this paper, we launch various innovative evasion attacks against several Android malware detection systems. The vulnerability inherent to all of these systems is that they are part of Androguard~\cite{desnos2011androguard}, a popular open source library used in Android malware detection systems. Some of the detection systems decrease to a 0\% detection rate after the attack. Therefore, the use of open source libraries in malware detection systems calls for caution.   In addition, we present a novel evaluation scheme for evasion attack generation that exploits the weak spots of known Android malware detection systems. In so doing, we evaluate the functionality and maliciousness of the manipulated instances created by our evasion attacks. We found variations in both the maliciousness and functionality tests of our manipulated apps. We show that non-functional apps, while considered malicious, do not threaten users and are thus useless from an attacker's point of view. We conclude that evasion attacks must be assessed for both functionality and maliciousness to evaluate their impact, a step which is far from commonplace today.

> Ransomware can produce direct and controllable economic loss, which makes it one of the most prominent threats in cyber security. As per the latest statistics, more than half of malwares reported in Q1 of 2017 are ransomwares and there is a potent threat of a novice cybercriminals accessing ransomware-as-a-service. The concept of public-key based data kidnapping and subsequent extortion was introduced in 1996. Since then, variants of ransomware emerged with different cryptosystems and larger key sizes, the underlying techniques remained same. Though there are works in literature which proposes a generic framework to detect the crypto ransomwares, we present a two step unsupervised detection tool which when suspects a process activity to be malicious, issues an alarm for further analysis to be carried in the second step and detects it with minimal traces. The two step detection framework- RAPPER uses Artificial Neural Network and Fast Fourier Transformation to develop a highly accurate, fast and reliable solution to ransomware detection using minimal trace points. We also introduce a special detection module for successful identification of disk encryption processes from potential ransomware operations, both having similar characteristics but with different objective. We provide a comprehensive solution to tackle almost all scenarios (standard benchmark, disk encryption and regular high computational processes) pertaining to the crypto ransomwares in light of software security.

> The increasing use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices for monitoring a wide spectrum of applications, along with the challenges of "big data" streaming support they often require for data analysis, is nowadays pushing for an increased attention to the emerging edge computing paradigm. In particular, smart approaches to manage and analyze data directly on the network edge, are more and more investigated, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered edge computing is envisaged to be a promising direction. In this paper, we focus on Data Centers (DCs) and Supercomputers (SCs), where a new generation of high-resolution monitoring systems is being deployed, opening new opportunities for analysis like anomaly detection and security, but introducing new challenges for handling the vast amount of data it produces. In detail, we report on a novel lightweight and scalable approach to increase the security of DCs/SCs, that involves AI-powered edge computing on high-resolution power consumption. The method -- called pAElla -- targets real-time Malware Detection (MD), it runs on an out-of-band IoT-based monitoring system for DCs/SCs, and involves Power Spectral Density of power measurements, along with AutoEncoders. Results are promising, with an F1-score close to 1, and a False Alarm and Malware Miss rate close to 0%. We compare our method with State-of-the-Art MD techniques and show that, in the context of DCs/SCs, pAElla can cover a wider range of malware, significantly outperforming SoA approaches in terms of accuracy. Moreover, we propose a methodology for online training suitable for DCs/SCs in production, and release open dataset and code.

> As the Internet is growing rapidly these years, the variant of malicious software, which often referred to as malware, has become one of the major and serious threats to Internet users. The dramatic increase of malware has led to a research area of not only using cutting edge machine learning techniques classify malware into their known families, moreover, recognize the unknown ones, which can be related to Open Set Recognition (OSR) problem in machine learning. Recent machine learning works have shed light on Open Set Recognition (OSR) from different scenarios. Under the situation of missing unknown training samples, the OSR system should not only correctly classify the known classes, but also recognize the unknown class. This survey provides an overview of different deep learning techniques, a discussion of OSR and graph representation solutions and an introduction of malware classification systems.

> Malware threats are a serious problem for computer security, and the ability to detect and classify malware is critical for maintaining the security level of a computer. Recently, a number of researchers are investigating techniques for classifying malware families using malware visualization, which convert the binary structure of malware into grayscale images. Although there have been many reports that applied CNN to malware visualization image classification, it has not been revealed how to pick out a model that fits a given malware dataset and achieves higher classification accuracy. We propose a strategy to select a Deep learning model that fits the malware visualization images. Our strategy uses the fine-tuning method for the pre-trained CNN model and a dataset that solves the imbalance problem. We chose the VGG19 model based on the proposed strategy to classify the Malimg dataset. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy is 99.72 %, which is higher than other previously proposed malware classification methods.

> Air-gap covert channels are special types of covert communication channels that enable attackers to exfiltrate data from isolated, network-less computers. Various types of air-gap covert channels have been demonstrated over the years, including electromagnetic, magnetic, acoustic, optical, and thermal.   In this paper, we introduce a new type of vibrational (seismic) covert channel. We observe that computers vibrate at a frequency correlated to the rotation speed of their internal fans. These inaudible vibrations affect the entire structure on which the computer is placed. Our method is based on malware's capability of controlling the vibrations generated by a computer, by regulating its internal fan speeds. We show that the malware-generated covert vibrations can be sensed by nearby smartphones via the integrated, sensitive \textit{accelerometers}. Notably, the accelerometer sensors in smartphones can be accessed by any app without requiring the user permissions, which make this attack highly evasive. We implemented AiR-ViBeR, malware that encodes binary information, and modulate it over a low frequency vibrational carrier. The data is then decoded by malicious application on a smartphone placed on the same surface (e.g., on a desk). We discuss the attack model, provide technical background, and present the implementation details and evaluation results. Our results show that using AiR-ViBeR, data can be exfiltrated from air-gapped computer to a nearby smartphone on the same table, or even an adjacent table, via vibrations. Finally, we propose a set of countermeasures for this new type of attack.

> Malware still constitutes a major threat in the cybersecurity landscape, also due to the widespread use of infection vectors such as documents. These infection vectors hide embedded malicious code to the victim users, facilitating the use of social engineering techniques to infect their machines. Research showed that machine-learning algorithms provide effective detection mechanisms against such threats, but the existence of an arms race in adversarial settings has recently challenged such systems. In this work, we focus on malware embedded in PDF files as a representative case of such an arms race. We start by providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the different approaches used to generate PDF malware, and of the corresponding learning-based detection systems. We then categorize threats specifically targeted against learning-based PDF malware detectors, using a well-established framework in the field of adversarial machine learning. This framework allows us to categorize known vulnerabilities of learning-based PDF malware detectors and to identify novel attacks that may threaten such systems, along with the potential defense mechanisms that can mitigate the impact of such threats. We conclude the paper by discussing how such findings highlight promising research directions towards tackling the more general challenge of designing robust malware detectors in adversarial settings.

> Control Flow Graph (CFG) similarity analysis is an essential technique for a variety of security analysis tasks, including malware detection and malware clustering. Even though various algorithms have been developed, existing CFG similarity analysis methods still suffer from limited efficiency, accuracy, and usability. In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy hashing scheme called topology-aware hashing (TAH) for effective and efficient CFG similarity analysis. Given the CFGs constructed from program binaries, we extract blended n-gram graphical features of the CFGs, encode the graphical features into numeric vectors (called graph signatures), and then measure the graph similarity by comparing the graph signatures. We further employ a fuzzy hashing technique to convert the numeric graph signatures into smaller fixed-size fuzzy hash signatures for efficient similarity calculation. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that TAH is more effective and efficient compared to existing CFG comparison techniques. To demonstrate the applicability of TAH to real-world security analysis tasks, we develop a binary similarity analysis tool based on TAH, and show that it outperforms existing similarity analysis tools while conducting malware clustering.

> Malware detection have used machine learning to detect malware in programs. These applications take in raw or processed binary data to neural network models to classify as benign or malicious files. Even though this approach has proven effective against dynamic changes, such as encrypting, obfuscating and packing techniques, it is vulnerable to specific evasion attacks where that small changes in the input data cause misclassification at test time. This paper proposes a new approach: MDEA, an Adversarial Malware Detection model uses evolutionary optimization to create attack samples to make the network robust against evasion attacks. By retraining the model with the evolved malware samples, its performance improves a significant margin.

> Cyber threats are increasing not only in their volume but also in their sophistication and difficulty to detect. Attacks have become a national/global threat as they have targeted private and public, as well as government sectors over the years. This is a growing issue and organisations are taking steps to reduce, detect and prevent threats. To do this they need to use systems that are equipped with the capabilities to do either of those steps and develop them for the type of networks they use, for instance wired or wireless. One of these systems are Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which can be used as the first defence mechanism or a secondary defence mechanism of a threat or an attack. There are different types of attacks that can occur in a network, such as Denial of service (DoS)/Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), port scanning, malware or ransomware and so forth that IDSs have a capability of detecting. Assisting in the mitigation of such attacks, there are also Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) whose role has a different purpose than that of IDSs. Unlike IDSs they not only detect threats but prevent them from disrupting the network, IPSs can be used in conjunction with IDSs to double the defences. This paper provides an overview of IDS and their classifications and IPS. It will detail typical benefits and limitations to using IDSs, IPSs and the hybrids (such as Intrusions Detection Prevention Systems (IDPSs and more)) which will be discussed further. It will also outline developments in the making using ML and how it is used to improve these systems and the dilemmas they produce and possible ways to counter act them.

> Internet-of-things (IoT) is perpetually revolutionizing our daily life and rapidly transforming physical objects into an ubiquitous connected ecosystem. Due to their massive deployment and moderate security levels, those devices face a lot of security, management, and control challenges. Their classical centralized architecture is still cloaking vulnerabilities and anomalies that can be exploited by hackers for spying, eavesdropping, and taking control of the network. In this paper, we propose to improve the IoT architecture with additional security features using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. We propose a novel architecture based on permissioned blockchain technology in order to build a scalable and decentralized end-to-end secure IoT system. Furthermore, we enhance the IoT system security with an AI-component at the gateway level to detect and classify suspected activities, malware, and cyber-attacks using machine learning techniques. Simulations and practical implementation show that the proposed architecture delivers high performance against cyber-attacks.

> Implementation flaws in cryptographic libraries, design flaws in underlying cryptographic primitives, and weaknesses in protocols using both, can all lead to exploitable vulnerabilities in software. Manually fixing such issues is challenging and resource consuming, especially when maintaining legacy software that contains broken or outdated cryptography, and for which source code may not be available. While there is existing work on identifying cryptographic primitives (often in the context of malware analysis), none of this prior work has focused on replacing such primitives with stronger (or more secure ones) after they have been identified. This paper explores feasibility of designing and implementing a toolchain for Augmentation and Legacy-software Instrumentation of Cryptographic Executables (ALICE). The key features of ALICE are: (i) automatically detecting and extracting implementations of weak or broken cryptographic primitives from binaries without requiring source code or debugging symbols, (ii) identifying the context and scope in which such primitives are used, and performing program analysis to determine the effects of replacing such implementations with more secure ones, and (iii) replacing implementations of weak primitives with those of stronger or more secure ones. We demonstrate practical feasibility of our approach on cryptographic hash functions with several popular cryptographic libraries and real-world programs of various levels of complexity. Our experimental results show that ALICE can locate and replace insecure hash functions, even in large binaries (we tested ones of size up to 1.5MB), while preserving existing functionality of the original binaries, and while incurring minimal execution-time overhead in the rewritten binaries. We also open source ALICE's code at https://github.com/SRI-CSL/ALICE.

We focus on broad aspects in network traffic analysis, including both malware detection and application classification. We release the datasets in the form of an open challenge called NetML and implement several machine learning methods including random-forest, SVM and MLP. As we continue to grow NetML, we expect the datasets to serve as a common platform for AI driven, reproducible research on network flow analytics.

> Deep learning is increasingly used as a building block of security systems. Unfortunately, neural networks are hard to interpret and typically opaque to the practitioner. The machine learning community has started to address this problem by developing methods for explaining the predictions of neural networks. While several of these approaches have been successfully applied in the area of computer vision, their application in security has received little attention so far. It is an open question which explanation methods are appropriate for computer security and what requirements they need to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce criteria for comparing and evaluating explanation methods in the context of computer security. These cover general properties, such as the accuracy of explanations, as well as security-focused aspects, such as the completeness, efficiency, and robustness. Based on our criteria, we investigate six popular explanation methods and assess their utility in security systems for malware detection and vulnerability discovery. We observe significant differences between the methods and build on these to derive general recommendations for selecting and applying explanation methods in computer security.

The proposed system adopts Intel SGX to implement the version policy management system that is safe from high-privileged malware.

> The proliferation of application specific cyber-physical systems coupled with the emergence of a variety of attacks on such systems (malware such as Mirai and Hajime) underlines the need to secure such networks. Most existing security efforts have focused on only detection of the presence of malware. However given the ability of most attacks to spread through the network once they infect a few devices, it is important to contain the spread of a virus and at the same time systematically cleanse the impacted nodes using the communication capabilities of the network. Toward this end, we present Airmed - a method and system to not just detect corruption of the application software on a IoT node, but to self correct itself using its neighbors. Airmed's decentralized mechanisms prevent the spread of self-propagating malware and can also be used as a technique for updating application code on such IoT devices. Among the novelties of Airmed are a novel bloom-filter technique along with hardware support to identify position of the malware program from the benign application code, an adaptive self-check for computational efficiency, and a uniform random-backoff and stream signatures for secure and bandwidth efficient code exchange to correct corrupted devices. We assess the performance of Airmed, using the embedded systems security architecture of TrustLite in the OMNeT++ simulator. The results show that Airmed scales up to thousands of devices, ensures guaranteed update of the entire network, and can recover 95% of the nodes in 10 minutes in both internal and external propagation models. Moreover, we evaluate memory and communication costs and show that Airmed is efficient and incurs very low overhead.

> The field of web has turned into a basic part in everyday life. Security in the web has dependably been a significant issue. Malware is utilized to rupture into the objective framework. There are various kinds of malwares, for example, infection, worms, rootkits, trojan pony, ransomware, etc. Each malware has its own way to deal with influence the objective framework in various ways, in this manner making hurt the framework. The rootkit may be in some arbitrary records, which when opened can change or erase the substance or information in the objective framework. Likewise, by opening the rootkit contaminated record may debase the framework execution. Hence, in this paper, a Kernel Rootkit Detection and Prevention (KRDP) framework is proposed an avert the records. The avoidance system in this paper utilizes a calculation to forestall the opening of the rootkit influenced record as portrayed. By and large, the framework comprises of a free antivirus programming which is restricted to certain functionalities. The proposed model beats the functionalities by utilizing a calculation, in this way identifying the rootkits first and afterward cautioning the client to react to the rootkit tainted record. In this way, keeping the client from opening the rootkit contaminated record. Inevitably, in the wake of expelling the tainted document from the framework will give an improvement in the general framework execution.

> It is known that attackers can exfiltrate data from air-gapped computers through their speakers via sonic and ultrasonic waves. To eliminate the threat of such acoustic covert channels in sensitive systems, audio hardware can be disabled and the use of loudspeakers can be strictly forbidden. Such audio-less systems are considered to be \textit{audio-gapped}, and hence immune to acoustic covert channels.   In this paper, we introduce a technique that enable attackers leak data acoustically from air-gapped and audio-gapped systems. Our developed malware can exploit the computer power supply unit (PSU) to play sounds and use it as an out-of-band, secondary speaker with limited capabilities. The malicious code manipulates the internal \textit{switching frequency} of the power supply and hence controls the sound waveforms generated from its capacitors and transformers. Our technique enables producing audio tones in a frequency band of 0-24khz and playing audio streams (e.g., WAV) from a computer power supply without the need for audio hardware or speakers. Binary data (files, keylogging, encryption keys, etc.) can be modulated over the acoustic signals and sent to a nearby receiver (e.g., smartphone). We show that our technique works with various types of systems: PC workstations and servers, as well as embedded systems and IoT devices that have no audio hardware at all. We provide technical background and discuss implementation details such as signal generation and data modulation. We show that the POWER-SUPPLaY code can operate from an ordinary user-mode process and doesn't need any hardware access or special privileges. Our evaluation shows that using POWER-SUPPLaY, sensitive data can be exfiltrated from air-gapped and audio-gapped systems from a distance of five meters away at a maximal bit rates of 50 bit/sec.

However, these approaches can be evaded by sparse evasion attacks that produce adversarial malware samples in which only few features are modified. This can be achieved, e.g., by injecting a small set of fake permissions and system calls into the malicious application, without compromising its intrusive functionality. To improve adversarial robustness against such sparse attacks, learning algorithms should avoid providing decisions which only rely upon a small subset of discriminant features; otherwise, even manipulating some of them may easily allow evading detection. Previous work showed that classifiers which avoid overemphasizing few discriminant features tend to be more robust against sparse attacks, and have developed simple metrics to help identify and select more robust algorithms. In this work, we aim to investigate whether gradient-based attribution methods used to explain classifiers' decisions by identifying the most relevant features can also be used to this end. Our intuition is that a classifier providing more uniform, evener attributions should rely upon a larger set of features, instead of overemphasizing few of them, thus being more robust against sparse attacks. We empirically investigate the connection between gradient-based explanations and adversarial robustness on a case study conducted on Android malware detection, and show that, in some cases, there is a strong correlation between the distribution of such explanations and adversarial robustness. We conclude the paper by discussing how our findings may thus enable the development of more efficient mechanisms both to evaluate and to improve adversarial robustness.

> Despite the potential of Machine learning (ML) to learn the behavior of malware, detect novel malware samples, and significantly improve information security (InfoSec) we see few, if any, high-impact ML techniques in deployed systems, notwithstanding multiple reported successes in open literature. We hypothesize that the failure of ML in making high-impacts in InfoSec are rooted in a disconnect between the two communities as evidenced by a semantic gap---a difference in how executables are described (e.g. the data and features extracted from the data). Specifically, current datasets and representations used by ML are not suitable for learning the behaviors of an executable and differ significantly from those used by the InfoSec community. In this paper, we survey existing datasets used for classifying malware by ML algorithms and the features that are extracted from the data. We observe that: 1) the current set of extracted features are primarily syntactic, not behavioral, 2) datasets generally contain extreme exemplars producing a dataset in which it is easy to discriminate classes, and 3) the datasets provide significantly different representations of the data encountered in real-world systems. For ML to make more of an impact in the InfoSec community requires a change in the data (including the features and labels) that is used to bridge the current semantic gap. As a first step in enabling more behavioral analyses, we label existing malware datasets with behavioral features using open-source threat reports associated with malware families. This behavioral labeling alters the analysis from identifying intent (e.g. good vs bad) or malware family membership to an analysis of which behaviors are exhibited by an executable. We offer the annotations with the hope of inspiring future improvements in the data that will further bridge the semantic gap between the ML and InfoSec communities.

> Quantum computing has evolved quickly in recent years and is showing significant benefits in a variety of fields. Malware analysis is one of those fields that could also take advantage of quantum computing. The combination of software used to locate the most frequent hashes and $n$-grams between benign and malicious software (KiloGram) and a quantum search algorithm could be beneficial, by loading the table of hashes and $n$-grams into a quantum computer, and thereby speeding up the process of mapping $n$-grams to their hashes. The first phase will be to use KiloGram to find the top-$k$ hashes and $n$-grams for a large malware corpus. From here, the resulting hash table is then loaded into a quantum machine. A quantum search algorithm is then used search among every permutation of the entangled key and value pairs to find the desired hash value. This prevents one from having to re-compute hashes for a set of $n$-grams, which can take on average $O(MN)$ time, whereas the quantum algorithm could take $O(\sqrt{N})$ in the number of table lookups to find the desired hash values.

> Network security has become an area of significant importance more than ever as highlighted by the eye-opening numbers of data breaches, attacks on critical infrastructure, and malware/ransomware/cryptojacker attacks that are reported almost every day. Increasingly, we are relying on networked infrastructure and with the advent of IoT, billions of devices will be connected to the internet, providing attackers with more opportunities to exploit. Traditional machine learning methods have been frequently used in the context of network security. However, such methods are more based on statistical features extracted from sources such as binaries, emails, and packet flows.   On the other hand, recent years witnessed a phenomenal growth in computer vision mainly driven by the advances in the area of convolutional neural networks. At a glance, it is not trivial to see how computer vision methods are related to network security. Nonetheless, there is a significant amount of work that highlighted how methods from computer vision can be applied in network security for detecting attacks or building security solutions. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of such work under three topics; i) phishing attempt detection, ii) malware detection, and iii) traffic anomaly detection. Next, we review a set of such commercial products for which public information is available and explore how computer vision methods are effectively used in those products. Finally, we discuss existing research gaps and future research directions, especially focusing on how network security research community and the industry can leverage the exponential growth of computer vision methods to build much secure networked systems.

> We propose Remote Attestation with TOCTOU Avoidance (RATA): a provably secure approach to address the RA TOCTOU problem. With RATA, even malware that erases itself before execution of the next RA, can not hide its ephemeral presence. RATA targets hybrid RA architectures (implemented as Hardware/Software co-designs), which are aimed at low-end embedded devices. We present two alternative techniques - RATAa and RATAb - suitable for devices with and without real-time clocks, respectively. Each is shown to be secure and accompanied by a publicly available and formally verified implementation. Our evaluation demonstrates low hardware overhead of both techniques. Compared with current RA architectures - that offer no TOCTOU protection - RATA incurs no extra runtime overhead. In fact, RATA substantially reduces computational costs of RA execution.

> Traffic classification has various applications in today's Internet, from resource allocation, billing and QoS purposes in ISPs to firewall and malware detection in clients. Classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning models have been widely used to solve the traffic classification task. However, training such models requires a large amount of labeled data. Labeling data is often the most difficult and time-consuming process in building a classifier. To solve this challenge, we reformulate the traffic classification into a multi-task learning framework where bandwidth requirement and duration of a flow are predicted along with the traffic class. The motivation of this approach is twofold: First, bandwidth requirement and duration are useful in many applications, including routing, resource allocation, and QoS provisioning. Second, these two values can be obtained from each flow easily without the need for human labeling or capturing flows in a controlled and isolated environment. We show that with a large amount of easily obtainable data samples for bandwidth and duration prediction tasks, and only a few data samples for the traffic classification task, one can achieve high accuracy. We conduct two experiment with ISCX and QUIC public datasets and show the efficacy of our approach.

> The daily amount of Android malicious applications (apps) targeting the app repositories is increasing, and their number is overwhelming the process of fingerprinting. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced Cypider framework, a set of techniques and tools aiming to perform a systematic detection of mobile malware by building a scalable and obfuscation resilient similarity network infrastructure of malicious apps. Our approach is based on our proposed concept, namely malicious community, in which we consider malicious instances that share common features are the most likely part of the same malware family. Using this concept, we presumably assume that multiple similar Android apps with different authors are most likely to be malicious. Specifically, Cypider leverages this assumption for the detection of variants of known malware families and zero-day malicious apps. Cypider applies community detection algorithms on the similarity network, which extracts sub-graphs considered as suspicious and possibly malicious communities. Furthermore, we propose a novel fingerprinting technique, namely community fingerprint, based on a one-class machine learning model for each malicious community. Besides, we proposed an enhanced Cypider framework, which requires less memory, x650, and less time to build the similarity network, x700, compared to the original version, without affecting the fingerprinting performance of the framework. We introduce a systematic approach to locate the best threshold on different feature content vectors, which simplifies the overall detection process.

> The wide acceptance of Internet of Things (IoT) for both household and industrial applications is accompanied by several security concerns. A major security concern is their probable abuse by adversaries towards their malicious intent. Understanding and analyzing IoT malicious behaviors is crucial, especially with their rapid growth and adoption in wide-range of applications. However, recent studies have shown that machine learning-based approaches are susceptible to adversarial attacks by adding junk codes to the binaries, for example, with an intention to fool those machine learning or deep learning-based detection systems. Realizing the importance of addressing this challenge, this study proposes a malware detection system that is robust to adversarial attacks. To do so, examine the performance of the state-of-the-art methods against adversarial IoT software crafted using the graph embedding and augmentation techniques. In particular, we study the robustness of such methods against two black-box adversarial methods, GEA and SGEA, to generate Adversarial Examples (AEs) with reduced overhead, and keeping their practicality intact. Our comprehensive experimentation with GEA-based AEs show the relation between misclassification and the graph size of the injected sample. Upon optimization and with small perturbation, by use of SGEA, all the IoT malware samples are misclassified as benign. This highlights the vulnerability of current detection systems under adversarial settings. With the landscape of possible adversarial attacks, we then propose DL-FHMC, a fine-grained hierarchical learning approach for malware detection and classification, that is robust to AEs with a capability to detect 88.52% of the malicious AEs.

> A software supply chain attack is characterized by the injection of malicious code into a software package in order to compromise dependent systems further down the chain. Recent years saw a number of supply chain attacks that leverage the increasing use of open source during software development, which is facilitated by dependency managers that automatically resolve, download and install hundreds of open source packages throughout the software life cycle. This paper presents a dataset of 174 malicious software packages that were used in real-world attacks on open source software supply chains, and which were distributed via the popular package repositories npm, PyPI, and RubyGems. Those packages, dating from November 2015 to November 2019, were manually collected and analyzed. The paper also presents two general attack trees to provide a structured overview about techniques to inject malicious code into the dependency tree of downstream users, and to execute such code at different times and under different conditions. This work is meant to facilitate the future development of preventive and detective safeguards by open source and research communities.

> Malware detection is an ever-present challenge for all organizational gatekeepers, who must maintain high detection rates while minimizing interruptions to the organization's workflow. To improve detection rates, organizations often deploy an ensemble of detectors. While effective, this approach is computationally expensive, since every file - even clear-cut cases - needs to be analyzed by all detectors. Moreover, with an ever-increasing number of files to process, the use of ensembles may incur unacceptable processing times and costs (e.g., cloud resources). In this study, we propose SPIREL, a reinforcement learning-based method for cost-effective malware detection. Our method enables organizations to directly associate costs to correct/incorrect classification, computing resources and run-time, and then dynamically establishes a security policy. This security policy is then implemented, and for each inspected file, a different set of detectors is assigned and a different detection threshold is set. Our evaluation on two malware domains- Portable Executable (PE) and Android Application Package (APK)files - shows that SPIREL is both accurate and extremely resource-efficient: the proposed method either outperforms the best performing baselines while achieving a modest improvement in efficiency, or reduces the required running time by ~80% while decreasing the accuracy and F1-score by only 0.5%. We also show that our approach is both highly transferable across different datasets and adaptable to changes in individual detector performance.

> Detection of malware cyber-attacks at the processor microarchitecture level has recently emerged as a promising solution to enhance the security of computer systems. Security mechanisms, such as hardware-based malware detection, use machine learning algorithms to classify and detect malware with the aid of Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) information. The ML classifiers are fed microarchitectural data extracted from Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs), which contain behavioral data about a software program. These HPCs are captured at run-time to model the program's behavior. Since the amount of HPCs are limited per processor, many techniques employ feature reduction to reduce the amount of HPCs down to the most essential attributes. Previous studies have already used binary classification to implement their malware detection after doing extensive feature reduction. This results in a simple identification of software being either malware or benign. This research comprehensively analyzes different hardware-based malware detectors by comparing different machine learning algorithms' accuracy with binary and multi-class classification models. Our experimental results indicate that when compared to complex machine learning models (e. g. Neural Network and Logistic), light-weight J48 and JRip algorithms perform better in detecting the malicious patterns even with the introduction of multiple types of malware. Although their detection accuracy slightly lowers, their robustness (Area Under the Curve) is still high enough that they deliver a reasonable false positive rate.

> Pattern recognition and machine learning techniques have been increasingly adopted in adversarial settings such as spam, intrusion and malware detection, although their security against well-crafted attacks that aim to evade detection by manipulating data at test time has not yet been thoroughly assessed. While previous work has been mainly focused on devising adversary-aware classification algorithms to counter evasion attempts, only few authors have considered the impact of using reduced feature sets on classifier security against the same attacks. An interesting, preliminary result is that classifier security to evasion may be even worsened by the application of feature selection. In this paper, we provide a more detailed investigation of this aspect, shedding some light on the security properties of feature selection against evasion attacks. Inspired by previous work on adversary-aware classifiers, we propose a novel adversary-aware feature selection model that can improve classifier security against evasion attacks, by incorporating specific assumptions on the adversary's data manipulation strategy. We focus on an efficient, wrapper-based implementation of our approach, and experimentally validate its soundness on different application examples, including spam and malware detection.

> Where can we find malware source code? This question is motivated by a real need: there is a dearth of malware source code, which impedes various types of security research. Our work is driven by the following insight: public archives, like GitHub, have a surprising number of malware repositories. Capitalizing on this opportunity, we propose, SourceFinder, a supervised-learning approach to identify repositories of malware source code efficiently. We evaluate and apply our approach using 97K repositories from GitHub. First, we show that our approach identifies malware repositories with 89% precision and 86% recall using a labeled dataset. Second, we use SourceFinder to identify 7504 malware source code repositories, which arguably constitutes the largest malware source code database. Finally, we study the fundamental properties and trends of the malware repositories and their authors. The number of such repositories appears to be growing by an order of magnitude every 4 years, and 18 malware authors seem to be "professionals" with well-established online reputation. We argue that our approach and our large repository of malware source code can be a catalyst for research studies, which are currently not possible.

> Counterfeit apps impersonate existing popular apps in attempts to misguide users to install them for various reasons such as collecting personal information or spreading malware. Many counterfeits can be identified once installed, however even a tech-savvy user may struggle to detect them before installation. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage the recent advances in deep learning methods to create image and text embeddings so that counterfeit apps can be efficiently identified when they are submitted for publication. We show that a novel approach of combining content embeddings and style embeddings outperforms the baseline methods for image similarity such as SIFT, SURF, and various image hashing methods. We first evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two well-known datasets for evaluating image similarity methods and show that content, style, and combined embeddings increase precision@k and recall@k by 10%-15% and 12%-25%, respectively when retrieving five nearest neighbours. Second, specifically for the app counterfeit detection problem, combined content and style embeddings achieve 12% and 14% increase in precision@k and recall@k, respectively compared to the baseline methods. Third, we present an analysis of approximately 1.2 million apps from Google Play Store and identify a set of potential counterfeits for top-10,000 popular apps. Under a conservative assumption, we were able to find 2,040 potential counterfeits that contain malware in a set of 49,608 apps that showed high similarity to one of the top-10,000 popular apps in Google Play Store. We also find 1,565 potential counterfeits asking for at least five additional dangerous permissions than the original app and 1,407 potential counterfeits having at least five extra third party advertisement libraries.

> Malicious domains are increasingly common and pose a severe cybersecurity threat. Specifically, many types of current cyber attacks use URLs for attack communications (e.g., C\&C, phishing, and spear-phishing). Despite the continuous progress in detecting these attacks, many alarming problems remain open, such as the weak spots of the defense mechanisms. Since machine learning has become one of the most prominent methods of malware detection, A robust feature selection mechanism is proposed that results in malicious domain detection models that are resistant to evasion attacks. This mechanism exhibits high performance based on empirical data. This paper makes two main contributions: First, it provides an analysis of robust feature selection based on widely used features in the literature. Note that even though the feature set dimensional space is reduced by half (from nine to four features), the performance of the classifier is still improved (an increase in the model's F1-score from 92.92\% to 95.81\%). Second, it introduces novel features that are robust to the adversary's manipulation. Based on an extensive evaluation of the different feature sets and commonly used classification models, this paper shows that models that are based on robust features are resistant to malicious perturbations, and at the same time useful for classifying non-manipulated data.

In this paper, we define a simple static analysis approach to first extract the features of the android application based on intents and categories the application into a known major category and later on mapping it with the permissions requested by the application and also comparing it with the most obvious intents of category.

> Detection and analysis of a potential malware specifically, used for ransom is a challenging task. Recently, intruders are utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to get hold of digital assets and then demand a ransom. It is believed that generally, the files comprise of some attributes, states, and patterns that can be recognized by a machine learning technique. This work thus focuses on the detection of Ransomware by performing feature engineering, which helps in analyzing vital attributes and behaviors of the malware. The main contribution of this work is the identification of important and distinct characteristics of Ransomware that can help in detecting them. Finally, based on the selected features, both conventional machine learning techniques and Transfer Learning based Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have been used to detect Ransomware. In order to perform feature engineering and analysis, two separate datasets (static and dynamic) were generated. The static dataset has 3646 samples (1700 Ransomware and 1946 Goodware). On the other hand, the dynamic dataset comprised of 3444 samples (1455 Ransomware and 1989 Goodware). Through various experiments, it is observed that the Registry changes, API calls, and DLLs are the most important features for Ransomware detection. Additionally, important sequences are found with the help of the N-Gram technique. It is also observed that in the case of Registry Delete operation, if a malicious file tries to delete registries, it follows a specific and repeated sequence. However, for the benign file, it doesnt follow any specific sequence or repetition. Similarly, an interesting observation made through this study is that there is no common Registry deleted sequence between malicious and benign files. And thus this discernible fact can be readily exploited for Ransomware detection.

> Historically, machine learning methods have not been designed with security in mind. In turn, this has given rise to adversarial examples, carefully perturbed input samples aimed to mislead detection at test time, which have been applied to attack spam and malware classification, and more recently to attack image classification. Consequently, an abundance of research has been devoted to designing machine learning methods that are robust to adversarial examples. Unfortunately, there are desiderata besides robustness that a secure and safe machine learning model must satisfy, such as fairness and privacy. Recent work by Song et al. (2019) has shown, empirically, that there exists a trade-off between robust and private machine learning models. Models designed to be robust to adversarial examples often overfit on training data to a larger extent than standard (non-robust) models. If a dataset contains private information, then any statistical test that separates training and test data by observing a model's outputs can represent a privacy breach, and if a model overfits on training data, these statistical tests become easier.   In this work, we identify settings where standard models will provably overfit to a larger extent in comparison to robust models, and as empirically observed in previous works, settings where the opposite behavior occurs. Thus, it is not necessarily the case that privacy must be sacrificed to achieve robustness. The degree of overfitting naturally depends on the amount of data available for training. We go on to formally characterize how the training set size factors into the privacy risks exposed by training a robust model. Finally, we empirically show our findings hold on image classification benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-10.

> Billions of wireless devices are foreseen to participate in big data aggregation and smart automation in order to interface the cyber and physical worlds. Such large-scale ultra-dense wireless connectivity is vulnerable to malicious software (malware) epidemics. Malware worms can exploit multi-hop wireless connectivity to stealthily diffuse throughout the wireless network without being noticed to security servers at the core network. Compromised devices can then be used by adversaries to remotely launch cyber attacks that cause large-scale critical physical damage and threaten public safety. This article overviews the types, threats, and propagation models for malware epidemics in large-scale wireless networks (LSWN). Then, the article proposes a novel and cost efficient countermeasure against malware epidemics in LSWN, denoted as spatial firewalls. It is shown that equipping a strategically selected small portion (i.e., less than 10\%) of the devices with state-of-the-art security mechanisms is sufficient to create spatially secured zones that quarantine malware epidemics. Quarantined infected devices are then cured by on-demand localized software patching. To this end, several firewall deployment strategies are discussed and compared.

> A promising avenue for improving the effectiveness of behavioral-based malware detectors would be to combine fast traditional machine learning detectors with high-accuracy, but time-consuming deep learning models. The main idea would be to place software receiving borderline classifications by traditional machine learning methods in an environment where uncertainty is added, while software is analyzed by more time-consuming deep learning models. The goal of uncertainty would be to rate-limit actions of potential malware during the time consuming deep analysis. In this paper, we present a detailed description of the analysis and implementation of CHAMELEON, a framework for realizing this uncertain environment for Linux. CHAMELEON offers two environments for software: (i) standard - for any software identified as benign by conventional machine learning methods and (ii) uncertain - for software receiving borderline classifications when analyzed by these conventional machine learning methods. The uncertain environment adds obstacles to software execution through random perturbations applied probabilistically on selected system calls. We evaluated CHAMELEON with 113 applications and 100 malware samples for Linux. Our results showed that at threshold 10%, intrusive and non-intrusive strategies caused approximately 65% of malware to fail accomplishing their tasks, while approximately 30% of the analyzed benign software to meet with various levels of disruption. With a dynamic, per-system call threshold, CHAMELEON caused 92% of the malware to fail, and only 10% of the benign software to be disrupted. We also found that I/O-bound software was three times more affected by uncertainty than CPU-bound software. Further, we analyzed the logs of software crashed with non-intrusive strategies, and found that some crashes are due to the software bugs.

> Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is critical for their mass deployment and public adoption. However, security attacks that violate safety constraints and cause accidents are a significant deterrent to achieving public trust in AVs, and that hinders a vendor's ability to deploy AVs. Creating a security hazard that results in a severe safety compromise (for example, an accident) is compelling from an attacker's perspective. In this paper, we introduce an attack model, a method to deploy the attack in the form of smart malware, and an experimental evaluation of its impact on production-grade autonomous driving software. We find that determining the time interval during which to launch the attack is{ critically} important for causing safety hazards (such as collisions) with a high degree of success. For example, the smart malware caused 33X more forced emergency braking than random attacks did, and accidents in 52.6% of the driving simulations.

> Domain Name Service is a trusted protocol made for name resolution, but during past years some approaches have been developed to use it for data transfer. DNS Tunneling is a method where data is encoded inside DNS queries, allowing information exchange through the DNS. This characteristic is attractive to hackers who exploit DNS Tunneling method to establish bidirectional communication with machines infected with malware with the objective of exfiltrating data or sending instructions in an obfuscated way. To detect these threats fast and accurately, the present work proposes a detection approach based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a minimal architecture complexity. Due to the lack of quality datasets for evaluating DNS Tunneling connections, we also present a detailed construction and description of a novel dataset that contains DNS Tunneling domains generated with five well-known DNS tools. Despite its simple architecture, the resulting CNN model correctly detected more than 92% of total Tunneling domains with a false positive rate close to 0.8%.

> Malicious software (malware) is a major cyber threat that shall be tackled with Machine Learning (ML) techniques because millions of new malware examples are injected into cyberspace on a daily basis. However, ML is known to be vulnerable to attacks known as adversarial examples. In this SoK paper, we systematize the field of Adversarial Malware Detection (AMD) through the lens of a unified framework of assumptions, attacks, defenses and security properties. This not only guides us to map attacks and defenses into some partial order structures, but also allows us to clearly describe the attack-defense arms race in the AMD context. In addition to manually drawing insights, we also propose using ML to draw insights from the systematized representation of the literature. Examples of the insights are: knowing the defender's feature set is critical to the attacker's success; attack tactic (as a core part of the threat model) largely determines what security property of a malware detector can be broke; there is currently no silver bullet defense against evasion attacks or poisoning attacks; defense tactic largely determines what security properties can be achieved by a malware detector; knowing attacker's manipulation set is critical to defender's success; ML is an effective method for insights learning in SoK studies. These insights shed light on future research directions.

> Generalized from image and language translation, graph translation aims to generate a graph in the target domain by conditioning an input graph in the source domain. This promising topic has attracted fast-increasing attention recently. Existing works are limited to either merely predicting the node attributes of graphs with fixed topology or predicting only the graph topology without considering node attributes, but cannot simultaneously predict both of them, due to substantial challenges: 1) difficulty in characterizing the interactive, iterative, and asynchronous translation process of both nodes and edges and 2) difficulty in discovering and maintaining the inherent consistency between the node and edge in predicted graphs. These challenges prevent a generic, end-to-end framework for joint node and edge attributes prediction, which is a need for real-world applications such as malware confinement in IoT networks and structural-to-functional network translation. These real-world applications highly depend on hand-crafting and ad-hoc heuristic models, but cannot sufficiently utilize massive historical data. In this paper, we termed this generic problem "multi-attributed graph translation" and developed a novel framework integrating both node and edge translations seamlessly. The novel edge translation path is generic, which is proven to be a generalization of the existing topology translation models. Then, a spectral graph regularization based on our non-parametric graph Laplacian is proposed in order to learn and maintain the consistency of the predicted nodes and edges. Finally, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world application data demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

> Label manipulation attacks are a subclass of data poisoning attacks in adversarial machine learning used against different applications, such as malware detection. These types of attacks represent a serious threat to detection systems in environments having high noise rate or uncertainty, such as complex networks and Internet of Thing (IoT). Recent work in the literature has suggested using the $K$-Nearest Neighboring (KNN) algorithm to defend against such attacks. However, such an approach can suffer from low to wrong detection accuracy. In this paper, we design an architecture to tackle the Android malware detection problem in IoT systems. We develop an attack mechanism based on Silhouette clustering method, modified for mobile Android platforms. We proposed two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-type deep learning algorithms against this \emph{Silhouette Clustering-based Label Flipping Attack (SCLFA)}. We show the effectiveness of these two defense algorithms - \emph{Label-based Semi-supervised Defense (LSD)} and \emph{clustering-based Semi-supervised Defense (CSD)} - in correcting labels being attacked. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by varying the various machine learning parameters on three Android datasets: Drebin, Contagio, and Genome and three types of features: API, intent, and permission. Our evaluation shows that using random forest feature selection and varying ratios of features can result in an improvement of up to 19\% accuracy when compared with the state-of-the-art method in the literature.

> Malware threat intelligence uncovers deep information about malware, threat actors, and their tactics, Indicators of Compromise(IoC), and vulnerabilities in different platforms from scattered threat sources. This collective information can guide decision making in cyber defense applications utilized by security operation centers(SoCs). In this paper, we introduce an open-source malware ontology - MALOnt that allows the structured extraction of information and knowledge graph generation, especially for threat intelligence. The knowledge graph that uses MALOnt is instantiated from a corpus comprising hundreds of annotated malware threat reports. The knowledge graph enables the analysis, detection, classification, and attribution of cyber threats caused by malware. We also demonstrate the annotation process using MALOnt on exemplar threat intelligence reports. A work in progress, this research is part of a larger effort towards auto-generation of knowledge graphs (KGs)for gathering malware threat intelligence from heterogeneous online resources.

> This paper presents an automated adversarial mechanism called WikipediaBot. WikipediaBot allows an adversary to create and control a bot infrastructure for the purpose of adversarial edits of Wikipedia articles. The WikipediaBot is a self-contained mechanism with modules for generating credentials for Wikipedia editors, bypassing login protections, and a production of contextually-relevant adversarial edits for target Wikipedia articles that evade conventional detection. The contextually-relevant adversarial edits are generated using an adversarial Markov chain that incorporates a linguistic manipulation attack known as MIM or malware-induced misperceptions. Because the nefarious use of WikipediaBot could result in harmful damages to the integrity of wide range of Wikipedia articles, we provide an elaborate discussion about the implications, detection, and defenses Wikipedia could employ to address the threat of automated adversarial manipulations and acts of Wikipedia vandalism.

> Electronic government (e-government) uses information and communication technologies to deliver public services to individuals and organisations effectively, efficiently and transparently. E-government is one of the most complex systems which needs to be distributed, secured and privacy-preserved, and the failure of these can be very costly both economically and socially. Most of the existing e-government systems such as websites and electronic identity management systems (eIDs) are centralized at duplicated servers and databases. A centralized management and validation system may suffer from a single point of failure and make the system a target to cyber attacks such as malware, denial of service attacks (DoS), and distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS). The blockchain technology enables the implementation of highly secure and privacy-preserving decentralized systems where transactions are not under the control of any third party organizations. Using the blockchain technology, exiting data and new data are stored in a sealed compartment of blocks (i.e., ledger) distributed across the network in a verifiable and immutable way. Information security and privacy are enhanced by the blockchain technology in which data are encrypted and distributed across the entire network. This paper proposes a framework of a decentralized e-government peer-to-peer (p2p) system using the blockchain technology, which can ensure both information security and privacy while simultaneously increasing the trust of the public sectors. In addition, a prototype of the proposed system is presented, with the support of a theoretical and qualitative analysis of the security and privacy implications of such system.

> Open set recognition (OSR) is the problem of classifying the known classes, meanwhile identifying the unknown classes when the collected samples cannot exhaust all the classes. There are many applications for the OSR problem. For instance, the frequently emerged new malware classes require a system that can classify the known classes and identify the unknown malware classes. In this paper, we propose an add-on extension for loss functions in neural networks to address the OSR problem. Our loss extension leverages the neural network to find polar representations for the known classes so that the representations of the known and the unknown classes become more effectively separable. Our contributions include: First, we introduce an extension that can be incorporated into different loss functions to find more discriminative representations. Second, we show that the proposed extension can significantly improve the performances of two different types of loss functions on datasets from two different domains. Third, we show that with the proposed extension, one loss function outperforms the others in terms of training time and model accuracy.

> An adversary who aims to steal a black-box model repeatedly queries the model via a prediction API to learn a function that approximates its decision boundary. Adversarial approximation is non-trivial because of the enormous combinations of model architectures, parameters, and features to explore. In this context, the adversary resorts to a best-effort strategy that yields the closest approximation. This paper explores best-effort adversarial approximation of a black-box malware classifier in the most challenging setting, where the adversary's knowledge is limited to a prediction label for a given input. Beginning with a limited input set for the black-box classifier, we leverage feature representation mapping and cross-domain transferability to approximate a black-box malware classifier by locally training a substitute. Our approach approximates the target model with different feature types for the target and the substitute model while also using non-overlapping data for training the target, training the substitute, and the comparison of the two. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against two black-box classifiers trained on Windows Portable Executables (PEs). Against a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on raw byte sequences of PEs, our approach achieves a 92% accurate substitute (trained on pixel representations of PEs), and nearly 90% prediction agreement between the target and the substitute model. Against a 97.8% accurate gradient boosted decision tree trained on static PE features, our 91% accurate substitute agrees with the black-box on 90% of predictions, suggesting the strength of our purely black-box approximation.

> Malware remains a big threat to cyber security, calling for machine learning based malware detection. While promising, such detectors are known to be vulnerable to evasion attacks. Ensemble learning typically facilitates countermeasures, while attackers can leverage this technique to improve attack effectiveness as well. This motivates us to investigate which kind of robustness the ensemble defense or effectiveness the ensemble attack can achieve, particularly when they combat with each other. We thus propose a new attack approach, named mixture of attacks, by rendering attackers capable of multiple generative methods and multiple manipulation sets, to perturb a malware example without ruining its malicious functionality. This naturally leads to a new instantiation of adversarial training, which is further geared to enhancing the ensemble of deep neural networks. We evaluate defenses using Android malware detectors against 26 different attacks upon two practical datasets. Experimental results show that the new adversarial training significantly enhances the robustness of deep neural networks against a wide range of attacks, ensemble methods promote the robustness when base classifiers are robust enough, and yet ensemble attacks can evade the enhanced malware detectors effectively, even notably downgrading the VirusTotal service.

> Data representation plays a critical role in the performance of novelty detection methods from machine learning (ML). Network traffic has conventionally posed many challenges to conventional anomaly detection, due to the inherent diversity of network traffic. Even within a single network, the most fundamental characteristics can change; this variability is fundamental to network traffic but especially true in the Internet of Things (IoT), where the network hosts a wide array of devices, each of which behaves differently, exhibiting high variance in both operational modalities and network activity patterns. Although there are established ways to study the effects of data representation in supervised learning, the problem is particularly challenging and understudied in the unsupervised learning context, where there is no standard way to evaluate the effect of selected features and representations at training time. This work explores different data representations for novelty detection in the Internet of Things, studying the effect of different representations of network traffic flows on the performance of a wide range of machine learning algorithms for novelty detection for problems arising in IoT, including malware detection, the detection of rogue devices, and the detection of cyberphysical anomalies. We find that no single representation works best (in terms of area under the curve) across devices or ML methods, yet the following features consistently improve the performance of novelty detection algorithms: (1) traffic sizes, (i.e., packet sizes rather than number of packets in volume-based representations); and (2) packet header fields (i.e., TTL, TCP flags).

> One of the major and serious threats that the Internet faces today is the vast amounts of data and files which need to be evaluated for potential malicious intent. Malicious software, often referred to as a malware that are designed by attackers are polymorphic and metamorphic in nature which have the capability to change their code as they spread. Moreover, the diversity and volume of their variants severely undermine the effectiveness of traditional defenses which typically use signature based techniques and are unable to detect the previously unknown malicious executables. The variants of malware families share typical behavioral patterns reflecting their origin and purpose. The behavioral patterns obtained either statically or dynamically can be exploited to detect and classify unknown malware into their known families using machine learning techniques. This survey paper provides an overview of techniques and tools for detecting and analyzing the malware.

> Android, being the most widespread mobile operating systems is increasingly becoming a target for malware. Malicious apps designed to turn mobile devices into bots that may form part of a larger botnet have become quite common, thus posing a serious threat. This calls for more effective methods to detect botnets on the Android platform. Hence, in this paper, we present a deep learning approach for Android botnet detection based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our proposed botnet detection system is implemented as a CNN-based model that is trained on 342 static app features to distinguish between botnet apps and normal apps. The trained botnet detection model was evaluated on a set of 6,802 real applications containing 1,929 botnets from the publicly available ISCX botnet dataset. The results show that our CNN-based approach had the highest overall prediction accuracy compared to other popular machine learning classifiers. Furthermore, the performance results observed from our model were better than those reported in previous studies on machine learning based Android botnet detection.

> In training their newly-developed malware detection methods, researchers rely on threshold-based labeling strategies that interpret the scan reports provided by online platforms, such as VirusTotal. The dynamicity of this platform renders those labeling strategies unsustainable over prolonged periods, which leads to inaccurate labels. Using inaccurately labeled apps to train and evaluate malware detection methods significantly undermines the reliability of their results, leading to either dismissing otherwise promising detection approaches or adopting intrinsically inadequate ones. The infeasibility of generating accurate labels via manual analysis and the lack of reliable alternatives force researchers to utilize VirusTotal to label apps. In the paper, we tackle this issue in two manners. Firstly, we reveal the aspects of VirusTotal's dynamicity and how they impact threshold-based labeling strategies and provide actionable insights on how to use these labeling strategies given VirusTotal's dynamicity reliably. Secondly, we motivate the implementation of alternative platforms by (a) identifying VirusTotal limitations that such platforms should avoid, and (b) proposing an architecture of how such platforms can be constructed to mitigate VirusTotal's limitations.

> The malware analysis and detection research community relies on the online platform VirusTotal to label Android apps based on the scan results of around 60 antiviral scanners. Unfortunately, there are no standards on how to best interpret the scan results acquired from VirusTotal, which leads to the utilization of different threshold-based labeling strategies (e.g., if ten or more scanners deem an app malicious, it is considered malicious). While some of the utilized thresholds may be able to accurately approximate the ground truths of apps, the fact that VirusTotal changes the set and versions of the scanners it uses makes such thresholds unsustainable over time. We implemented a method, Maat, that tackles these issues of standardization and sustainability by automatically generating a Machine Learning (ML)-based labeling scheme, which outperforms threshold-based labeling strategies. Using the VirusTotal scan reports of 53K Android apps that span one year, we evaluated the applicability of Maat's ML-based labeling strategies by comparing their performance against threshold-based strategies. We found that such ML-based strategies (a) can accurately and consistently label apps based on their VirusTotal scan reports, and (b) contribute to training ML-based detection methods that are more effective at classifying out-of-sample apps than their threshold-based counterparts.

For the first time, to the author's knowledge, the industry-standard Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 vulnerabilities and CWE/SANS top 25 most dangerous software errors are synced up in a matrix with Checkmarx vulnerability queries, producing an application security framework that helps development teams review and address code vulnerabilities, minimise false positives discovered in static scans and penetration tests, targeting an increased accuracy of the findings. A case study is conducted for vulnerabilities scanning of a proof-of-concept mobile malware detection app. Mapping the OWASP/SANS with Checkmarx vulnerabilities queries, flaws and vulnerabilities are demonstrated to be mitigated with improved efficiency.

> Over the past years, literature has shown that attacks exploiting the microarchitecture of modern processors pose a serious threat to the privacy of mobile phone users. This is because applications leave distinct footprints in the processor, which can be used by malware to infer user activities. In this work, we show that these inference attacks are considerably more practical when combined with advanced AI techniques. In particular, we focus on profiling the activity in the last-level cache (LLC) of ARM processors. We employ a simple Prime+Probe based monitoring technique to obtain cache traces, which we classify with Deep Learning methods including Convolutional Neural Networks. We demonstrate our approach on an off-the-shelf Android phone by launching a successful attack from an unprivileged, zeropermission App in well under a minute. The App thereby detects running applications with an accuracy of 98% and reveals opened websites and streaming videos by monitoring the LLC for at most 6 seconds. This is possible, since Deep Learning compensates measurement disturbances stemming from the inherently noisy LLC monitoring and unfavorable cache characteristics such as random line replacement policies. In summary, our results show that thanks to advanced AI techniques, inference attacks are becoming alarmingly easy to implement and execute in practice. This once more calls for countermeasures that confine microarchitectural leakage and protect mobile phone applications, especially those valuing the privacy of their users.

> Third-party security apps are an integral part of the Android app ecosystem. Many users install them as an extra layer of protection for their devices. There are hundreds of such security apps, both free and paid in Google Play Store and some of them are downloaded millions of times. By installing security apps, the smartphone users place a significant amount of trust towards the security companies who developed these apps, because a fully functional mobile security app requires access to many smartphone resources such as the storage, text messages and email, browser history, and information about other installed applications. Often these resources contain highly sensitive personal information. As such, it is essential to understand the mobile security apps ecosystem to assess whether is it indeed beneficial to install them. To this end, in this paper, we present the first empirical study of Android security apps. We analyse 100 Android security apps from multiple aspects such as metadata, static analysis, and dynamic analysis and presents insights to their operations and behaviours. Our results show that 20% of the security apps we studied potentially resell the data they collect from smartphones to third parties; in some cases, even without the user consent. Also, our experiments show that around 50% of the security apps fail to identify malware installed on a smartphone.

> During the past four years, Flash malware has become one of the most insidious threats to detect, with almost 600 critical vulnerabilities targeting Adobe Flash disclosed in the wild. Research has shown that machine learning can be successfully used to detect Flash malware by leveraging static analysis to extract information from the structure of the file or its bytecode. However, the robustness of Flash malware detectors against well-crafted evasion attempts - also known as adversarial examples - has never been investigated. In this paper, we propose a security evaluation of a novel, representative Flash detector that embeds a combination of the prominent, static features employed by state-of-the-art tools. In particular, we discuss how to craft adversarial Flash malware examples, showing that it suffices to manipulate the corresponding source malware samples slightly to evade detection. We then empirically demonstrate that popular defense techniques proposed to mitigate evasion attempts, including re-training on adversarial examples, may not always be sufficient to ensure robustness. We argue that this occurs when the feature vectors extracted from adversarial examples become indistinguishable from those of benign data, meaning that the given feature representation is intrinsically vulnerable. In this respect, we are the first to formally define and quantitatively characterize this vulnerability, highlighting when an attack can be countered by solely improving the security of the learning algorithm, or when it requires also considering additional features. We conclude the paper by suggesting alternative research directions to improve the security of learning-based Flash malware detectors.

> Android remains an attractive target for malware authors and as such, the mobile platform is still highly prone to infections caused by malicious applications. To tackle this problem, malware classifiers leveraging machine learning techniques have been proposed, with varying degrees of success. They often need to rely on a large, diverse set of features -- which are indicative of apps installed by users. This, in turn, raises privacy concerns as it has been shown that features used to train and test machine learning models can provide insights into user's preferences. As such, there is a need for a decentralized, privacy-respecting Android malware classifier which can protect users from both malware infections and the misuse of private, sensitive information stored on their mobile devices.   To fill this gap, we propose LiM -- a malware classification framework which leverages the power of Federated Learning to detect and classify malicious apps in a privacy-respecting manner. Data about newly installed apps is kept locally on the users' devices while users benefit from the learning process from each other, and the service provider cannot infer which apps were installed by each user. To realize such classifier in a setting where users cannot provide ground truth (i.e. they cannot tell whether an app is malicious), we use a safe semi-supervised ensemble that maximizes the increase on classification accuracy with respect to a baseline classifier the service provider trains.   We implement LiM and show that the cloud has F1 score of 95%, while clients have perfect recall with only 1 false positive in >100 apps, using a dataset of 25K clean apps and 25K malicious apps, 200 users and 50 rounds of federation. Furthermore, we also conducted a security analysis to demonstrate that LiM remains robust against poisoning attacks.

> In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), Malware has been proliferating exponentially over the past decade. Traditional anti-virus software are ineffective against modern complex Malware. In order to address this challenge, researchers have proposed Hardware-assisted Malware Detection (HMD) using Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs). The HPCs are used to train a set of Machine learning (ML) classifiers, which in turn, are used to distinguish benign programs from Malware. Recently, adversarial attacks have been designed by introducing perturbations in the HPC traces using an adversarial sample predictor to misclassify a program for specific HPCs. These attacks are designed with the basic assumption that the attacker is aware of the HPCs being used to detect Malware. Since modern processors consist of hundreds of HPCs, restricting to only a few of them for Malware detection aids the attacker. In this paper, we propose a Moving target defense (MTD) for this adversarial attack by designing multiple ML classifiers trained on different sets of HPCs. The MTD randomly selects a classifier; thus, confusing the attacker about the HPCs or the number of classifiers applied. We have developed an analytical model which proves that the probability of an attacker to guess the perfect HPC-classifier combination for MTD is extremely low (in the range of $10^{-1864}$ for a system with 20 HPCs). Our experimental results prove that the proposed defense is able to improve the classification accuracy of HPC traces that have been modified through an adversarial sample generator by up to 31.5%, for a near perfect (99.4%) restoration of the original accuracy.

> A large majority of cheap Internet of Things (IoT) devices that arrive brand new, and are configured with out-of-the-box settings, are not being properly secured by the manufactures, and are vulnerable to existing malware lurking on the Internet. Among them is the Mirai botnet which has had its source code leaked to the world, allowing any malicious actor to configure and unleash it. A combination of software assets not being utilised safely and effectively are exposing consumers to a full compromise. We configured and attacked 4 different IoT devices using the Mirai libraries. Our experiments concluded that three out of the four devices were vulnerable to the Mirai malware and became infected when deployed using their default configuration. This demonstrates that the original security configurations are not sufficient to provide acceptable levels of protection for consumers, leaving their devices exposed and vulnerable. By analysing the Mirai libraries and its attack vectors, we were able to determine appropriate device configuration countermeasures to harden the devices against this botnet, which were successfully validated through experimentation.

> Client-side malware can attack users by tampering with applications or user interfaces to generate requests that users did not intend. We propose Verified Intention (VInt), which ensures a network request, as received by a service, is user-intended. VInt is based on "seeing what the user sees" (context). VInt screenshots the user interface as the user interacts with a security-sensitive form. There are two main components. First, VInt ensures output integrity and authenticity by validating the context, ensuring the user sees correctly rendered information. Second, VInt extracts user-intended inputs from the on-screen user-provided inputs, with the assumption that a human user checks what they entered. Using the user-intended inputs, VInt deems a request to be user-intended if the request is generated properly from the user-intended inputs while the user is shown the correct information. VInt is implemented using image analysis and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Our evaluation shows that VInt is accurate and efficient.

> Finding meaningful clusters in drive-by-download malware data is a particularly difficult task. Malware data tends to contain overlapping clusters with wide variations of cardinality. This happens because there can be considerable similarity between malware samples (some are even said to belong to the same family), and these tend to appear in bursts. Clustering algorithms are usually applied to normalised data sets. However, the process of normalisation aims at setting features with different range values to have a similar contribution to the clustering. It does not favour more meaningful features over those that are less meaningful, an effect one should perhaps expect of the data pre-processing stage.   In this paper we introduce a method to deal precisely with the problem above. This is an iterative data pre-processing method capable of aiding to increase the separation between clusters. It does so by calculating the within-cluster degree of relevance of each feature, and then it uses these as a data rescaling factor. By repeating this until convergence our malware data was separated in clear clusters, leading to a higher average silhouette width.

> Malicious PDF files represent one of the biggest threats to computer security. To detect them, significant research has been done using handwritten signatures or machine learning based on manual feature extraction. Those approaches are both time-consuming, require significant prior knowledge and the list of features has to be updated with each newly discovered vulnerability. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that uses an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the byte level of the file, without any handcrafted features. We show, using a data set of 90000 files downloadable online, that our approach maintains a high detection rate (94%) of PDF malware and even detects new malicious files, still undetected by most antiviruses. Using automatically generated features from our CNN network, and applying a clustering algorithm, we also obtain high similarity between the antiviruses' labels and the resulting clusters.

> Numerous metamorphic and polymorphic malicious variants are generated automatically on a daily basis by mutation engines that transform the code of a malicious program while retaining its functionality, in order to evade signature-based detection. These automatic processes have greatly increased the number of malware variants, deeming their fully-manual analysis impossible. Malware classification is the task of determining to which family a new malicious variant belongs. Variants of the same malware family show similar behavioral patterns. Thus, classifying newly discovered variants helps assess the risks they pose and determine which of them should undergo manual analysis by a security expert. This motivated intense research in recent years of how to devise high-accuracy automatic tools for malware classification. In this paper, we present DAEMON - a novel dataset-agnostic and even platform-agnostic malware classifier. We've optimized DAEMON using a large-scale dataset of x86 binaries, belonging to a mix of several malware families targeting computers running Windows. We then applied it, without any algorithmic change, features re-engineering or parameter tuning, to two other large-scale datasets of malicious Android applications of numerous malware families. DAEMON obtained top-notch classification results on all datasets, making it the first provably dataset-agnostic malware classifier to date. An important byproduct of the type of features used by DAEMON and the manner in which they are mined is that its classification results are explainable.

> Many Android applications embed webpages via WebView components and execute JavaScript code within Android. Hybrid applications leverage dedicated APIs to load a resource and render it in a WebView. Furthermore, Android objects can be shared with the JavaScript world. However, bridging the interfaces of the Android and JavaScript world might also incur severe security threats: Potentially untrusted webpages and their JavaScript might interfere with the Android environment and its access to native features. No general analysis is currently available to assess the implications of such hybrid apps bridging the two worlds. To understand the semantics and effects of hybrid apps, we perform a large-scale study on the usage of the hybridization APIs in the wild. We analyze and categorize the parameters to hybridization APIs for 7,500 randomly selected and the 196 most popular applications from the Google Playstore as well as 1000 malware samples. Our results advance the general understanding of hybrid applications, as well as implications for potential program analyses, and the current security situation: We discovered thousands of flows of sensitive data from Android to JavaScript, the vast majority of which could flow to potentially untrustworthy code. Our analysis identified numerous web pages embedding vulnerabilities, which we exemplarily exploited. Additionally, we discovered a multitude of applications in which potentially untrusted JavaScript code may interfere with (trusted) Android objects, both in benign and malign applications.

> A crucial technical challenge for cybercriminals is to keep control over the potentially millions of infected devices that build up their botnets, without compromising the robustness of their attacks. A single, fixed C&C server, for example, can be trivially detected either by binary or traffic analysis and immediately sink-holed or taken-down by security researchers or law enforcement. Botnets often use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs), primarily to evade take-down mechanisms. DGAs enlarge the lifespan of a malware campaign, thus enhancing its profitability. They can also contribute to hardening attack attribution. In this work, we introduce HYDRA the most comprehensive and complete available dataset of Algorithmically-Generated Domains (AGD). The dataset contains more than 100 DGA families, including both real-world and adversarial ones. We analyse the dataset and discuss the possibility of differentiating between benign requests (to real domains) and malicious ones (to AGDs) in real-time. The simultaneous study of so many families and variants introduces several challenges; nonetheless, it alleviates biases found in previous literature that deals with small datasets and exploit some characteristic features of particular families. To this end, we thoroughly compare our approach with the current state-of-the-art and highlight some methodological shortcomings in the actual state of practice. The outcomes obtained show that our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

> It is becoming more common that adversary attacks consist of more than a standalone executable or script. Often, evidence of an attack includes conspicuous process heritage that may be ignored by traditional static machine learning models. Advanced attacker techniques, like "living off the land" that appear normal in isolation become more suspicious when observed in a parent-child context. The context derived from parent-child process chains can help identify and group malware families, as well as discover novel attacker techniques. Adversaries chain these techniques to achieve persistence, bypass defenses, and execute actions. Traditional heuristic-based detections often generate noise or disparate events that belong to what constitutes a single attack. ProblemChild is a graph-based framework designed to address these issues. ProblemChild applies a supervised learning classifier to derive a weighted graph used to identify communities of seemingly disparate events into larger attack sequences. ProblemChild applies conditional probability to automatically rank anomalous communities as well as suppress commonly occurring parent-child chains. In combination, this framework can be used by analysts to aid in the crafting or tuning of detectors and reduce false-positives over time. We evaluate ProblemChild against the 2018 MITRE ATT&CK(TM) emulation of APT3 attack to demonstrate its promise in identifying anomalous parent-child process chains.

> With the rapid growth of Android malware, many machine learning-based malware analysis approaches are proposed to mitigate the severe phenomenon. However, such classifiers are opaque, non-intuitive, and difficult for analysts to understand the inner decision reason. For this reason, a variety of explanation approaches are proposed to interpret predictions by providing important features. Unfortunately, the explanation results obtained in the malware analysis domain cannot achieve a consensus in general, which makes the analysts confused about whether they can trust such results. In this work, we propose principled guidelines to assess the quality of five explanation approaches by designing three critical quantitative metrics to measure their stability, robustness, and effectiveness. Furthermore, we collect five widely-used malware datasets and apply the explanation approaches on them in two tasks, including malware detection and familial identification. Based on the generated explanation results, we conduct a sanity check of such explanation approaches in terms of the three metrics. The results demonstrate that our metrics can assess the explanation approaches and help us obtain the knowledge of most typical malicious behaviors for malware analysis.

> Behavior of a malware varies with respect to malware types. Therefore,knowing type of a malware affects strategies of system protection softwares. Many malware type classification models empowered by machine and deep learning achieve superior accuracies to predict malware types.Machine learning based models need to do heavy feature engineering and feature engineering is dominantly effecting performance of models.On the other hand, deep learning based models require less feature engineering than machine learning based models. However, traditional deep learning architectures and components cause very complex and data sensitive models. Capsule network architecture minimizes this complexity and data sensitivity unlike classical convolutional neural network architectures. This paper proposes an ensemble capsule network model based on bootstrap aggregating technique. The proposed method are tested on two malware datasets, whose the-state-of-the-art results are well-known.

> Android users are increasingly concerned with the privacy of their data and security of their devices. To improve the security awareness of users, recent automatic techniques produce security-centric descriptions by performing program analysis. However, the generated text does not always address users' concerns as they are generally too technical to be understood by ordinary users. Moreover, different users have varied linguistic preferences, which do not match the text. Motivated by this challenge, we develop an innovative scheme to help users avoid malware and privacy-breaching apps by generating security descriptions that explain the privacy and security related aspects of an Android app in clear and understandable terms. We implement a prototype system, PERSCRIPTION, to generate personalised security-centric descriptions that automatically learn users' security concerns and linguistic preferences to produce user-oriented descriptions. We evaluate our scheme through experiments and user studies. The results clearly demonstrate the improvement on readability and users' security awareness of PERSCRIPTION's descriptions compared to existing description generators.

> Many users implicitly assume that software can only be exploited after it is installed. However, recent supply-chain attacks demonstrate that application integrity must be ensured during installation itself. We introduce SIGL, a new tool for detecting malicious behavior during software installation. SIGL collects traces of system call activity, building a data provenance graph that it analyzes using a novel autoencoder architecture with a graph long short-term memory network (graph LSTM) for the encoder and a standard multilayer perceptron for the decoder. SIGL flags suspicious installations as well as the specific installation-time processes that are likely to be malicious. Using a test corpus of 625 malicious installers containing real-world malware, we demonstrate that SIGL has a detection accuracy of 96%, outperforming similar systems from industry and academia by up to 87% in precision and recall and 45% in accuracy. We also demonstrate that SIGL can pinpoint the processes most likely to have triggered malicious behavior, works on different audit platforms and operating systems, and is robust to training data contamination and adversarial attack. It can be used with application-specific models, even in the presence of new software versions, as well as application-agnostic meta-models that encompass a wide range of applications and installers.

> State of the art deep learning techniques are known to be vulnerable to evasion attacks where an adversarial sample is generated from a malign sample and misclassified as benign. Detection of encrypted malware command and control traffic based on TCP/IP flow features can be framed as a learning task and is thus vulnerable to evasion attacks. However, unlike e.g. in image processing where generated adversarial samples can be directly mapped to images, going from flow features to actual TCP/IP packets requires crafting the sequence of packets, with no established approach for such crafting and a limitation on the set of modifiable features that such crafting allows. In this paper we discuss learning and evasion consequences of the gap between generated and crafted adversarial samples. We exemplify with a deep neural network detector trained on a public C2 traffic dataset, white-box adversarial learning, and a proxy-based approach for crafting longer flows. Our results show 1) the high evasion rate obtained by using generated adversarial samples on the detector can be significantly reduced when using crafted adversarial samples; 2) robustness against adversarial samples by model hardening varies according to the crafting approach and corresponding set of modifiable features that the attack allows for; 3) incrementally training hardened models with adversarial samples can produce a level playing field where no detector is best against all attacks and no attack is best against all detectors, in a given set of attacks and detectors. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that level playing field feature set- and iteration-hardening are analyzed in encrypted C2 malware traffic detection.

> Currently, Android malware detection is mostly performed on server side against the increasing number of malware. Powerful computing resource provides more exhaustive protection for app markets than maintaining detection by a single user. However, apart from the applications provided by the official market, apps from unofficial markets and third-party resources are always causing serious security threats to end-users. Meanwhile, it is a time-consuming task if the app is downloaded first and then uploaded to the server side for detection, because the network transmission has a lot of overhead. In addition, the uploading process also suffers from the security threats of attackers. Consequently, a last line of defense on mobile devices is necessary and much-needed. In this paper, we propose an effective Android malware detection system, MobiTive, leveraging customized deep neural networks to provide a real-time and responsive detection environment on mobile devices. MobiTive is a preinstalled solution rather than an app scanning and monitoring engine using after installation, which is more practical and secure. Original deep learning models cannot be directly deployed and executed on mobile devices due to various performance limitations, such as computation power, memory size, and energy. Therefore, we evaluate and investigate the following key points:(1) the performance of different feature extraction methods based on source code or binary code;(2) the performance of different feature type selections for deep learning on mobile devices;(3) the detection accuracy of different deep neural networks on mobile devices;(4) the real-time detection performance and accuracy on different mobile devices;(5) the potential based on the evolution trend of mobile devices' specifications; and finally we further propose a practical solution (MobiTive) to detect Android malware on mobile devices.

> Machine learning (ML) based approach is considered as one of the most promising techniques for Android malware detection and has achieved high accuracy by leveraging commonly-used features. In practice, most of the ML classifications only provide a binary label to mobile users and app security analysts. However, stakeholders are more interested in the reason why apps are classified as malicious in both academia and industry. This belongs to the research area of interpretable ML but in a specific research domain (i.e., mobile malware detection). Although several interpretable ML methods have been exhibited to explain the final classification results in many cutting-edge Artificial Intelligent (AI) based research fields, till now, there is no study interpreting why an app is classified as malware or unveiling the domain-specific challenges.   In this paper, to fill this gap, we propose a novel and interpretable ML-based approach (named XMal) to classify malware with high accuracy and explain the classification result meanwhile. (1) The first classification phase of XMal hinges multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and attention mechanism, and also pinpoints the key features most related to the classification result. (2) The second interpreting phase aims at automatically producing neural language descriptions to interpret the core malicious behaviors within apps. We evaluate the behavior description results by comparing with the existing interpretable ML-based methods (i.e., Drebin and LIME) to demonstrate the effectiveness of XMal. We find that XMal is able to reveal the malicious behaviors more accurately. Additionally, our experiments show that XMal can also interpret the reason why some samples are misclassified by ML classifiers. Our study peeks into the interpretable ML through the research of Android malware detection and analysis.

> Yara rules are a ubiquitous tool among cybersecurity practitioners and analysts. Developing high-quality Yara rules to detect a malware family of interest can be labor- and time-intensive, even for expert users. Few tools exist and relatively little work has been done on how to automate the generation of Yara rules for specific families. In this paper, we leverage large n-grams ($n \geq 8$) combined with a new biclustering algorithm to construct simple Yara rules more effectively than currently available software. Our method, AutoYara, is fast, allowing for deployment on low-resource equipment for teams that deploy to remote networks. Our results demonstrate that AutoYara can help reduce analyst workload by producing rules with useful true-positive rates while maintaining low false-positive rates, sometimes matching or even outperforming human analysts. In addition, real-world testing by malware analysts indicates AutoYara could reduce analyst time spent constructing Yara rules by 44-86%, allowing them to spend their time on the more advanced malware that current tools can't handle.

> String obfuscation is an established technique used by proprietary, closed-source applications to protect intellectual property. Furthermore, it is also frequently used to hide spyware or malware in applications. In both cases, the techniques range from bit-manipulation over XOR operations to AES encryption. However, string obfuscation techniques/tools suffer from one shared weakness: They generally have to embed the necessary logic to deobfuscate strings into the app code.   In this paper, we show that most of the string obfuscation techniques found in malicious and benign applications for Android can easily be broken in an automated fashion. We developed StringHound, an open-source tool that uses novel techniques that identify obfuscated strings and reconstruct the originals using slicing.   We evaluated StringHound on both benign and malicious Android apps. In summary, we deobfuscate almost 30 times more obfuscated strings than other string deobfuscation tools. Additionally, we analyzed 100,000 Google Play Store apps and found multiple obfuscated strings that hide vulnerable cryptographic usages, insecure internet accesses, API keys, hard-coded passwords, and exploitation of privileges without the awareness of the developer. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that not only malware uses string obfuscation but also benign apps make extensive use of string obfuscation.

> Universal Serial Bus (USB) Flash Drives are nowadays one of the most convenient and diffused means to transfer files, especially when no Internet connection is available. However, USB flash drives are also one of the most common attack vectors used to gain unauthorized access to host devices. For instance, it is possible to replace a USB drive so that when the USB key is connected, it would install passwords stealing tools, root-kit software, and other disrupting malware. In such a way, an attacker can steal sensitive information via the USB-connected devices, as well as inject any kind of malicious software into the host.   To thwart the above-cited raising threats, we propose MAGNETO, an efficient, non-interactive, and privacy-preserving framework to verify the authenticity of a USB flash drive, rooted in the analysis of its unintentional magnetic emissions. We show that the magnetic emissions radiated during boot operations on a specific host are unique for each device, and sufficient to uniquely fingerprint both the brand and the model of the USB flash drive, or the specific USB device, depending on the used equipment. Our investigation on 59 different USB flash drives---belonging to 17 brands, including the top brands purchased on Amazon in mid-2019---, reveals a minimum classification accuracy of 98.2% in the identification of both brand and model, accompanied by a negligible time and computational overhead. MAGNETO can also identify the specific USB Flash drive, with a minimum classification accuracy of 91.2%. Overall, MAGNETO proves that unintentional magnetic emissions can be considered as a viable and reliable means to fingerprint read-only USB flash drives. Finally, future research directions in this domain are also discussed.

> We extend the framework of Classification with Costly Features to work with structured samples, that can no longer be represented as fixed-length vectors. Instead, the samples can only be represented as trees of features, with a variable and possibly unlimited depth and breadth, similar to a JSON file. We provide a method that, independently for each sample, sequentially selects features from the tree. The newly acquired features can be further expanded, until the algorithm terminates with a classification decision. Each piece of information has a real-valued cost, and the objective is to maximize the classification accuracy while minimizing the total cost of the selected features. The method targets data naturally occurring in many domains, e.g., targeted advertising, medical diagnosis, or malware detection. We demonstrate our deep reinforcement learning based algorithm in seven relational classification datasets.

> Malware continues to be a major cyber threat, despite the tremendous effort that has been made to combat them. The number of malware in the wild steadily increases over time, meaning that we must resort to automated defense techniques. This naturally calls for machine learning based malware detection. However, machine learning is known to be vulnerable to adversarial evasion attacks that manipulate a small number of features to make classifiers wrongly recognize a malware sample as a benign one. The state-of-the-art is that there are no effective countermeasures against these attacks. Inspired by the AICS'2019 Challenge, we systematize a number of principles for enhancing the robustness of neural networks against adversarial malware evasion attacks. Some of these principles have been scattered in the literature, but others are proposed in this paper for the first time. Under the guidance of these principles, we propose a framework and an accompanying training algorithm, which are then applied to the AICS'2019 challenge. Our experimental results have been submitted to the challenge organizer for evaluation.

> The attention that deep learning has garnered from the academic community and industry continues to grow year over year, and it has been said that we are in a new golden age of artificial intelligence research. However, neural networks are still often seen as a "black box" where learning occurs but cannot be understood in a human-interpretable way. Since these machine learning systems are increasingly being adopted in security contexts, it is important to explore these interpretations. We consider an Android malware traffic dataset for approaching this problem. Then, using the information plane, we explore how homeomorphism affects learned representation of the data and the invariance of the mutual information captured by the parameters on that data. We empirically validate these results, using accuracy as a second measure of similarity of learned representations.   Our results suggest that although the details of learned representations and the specific coordinate system defined over the manifold of all parameters differ slightly, the functional approximations are the same. Furthermore, our results show that since mutual information remains invariant under homeomorphism, only feature engineering methods that alter the entropy of the dataset will change the outcome of the neural network. This means that for some datasets and tasks, neural networks require meaningful, human-driven feature engineering or changes in architecture to provide enough information for the neural network to generate a sufficient statistic. Applying our results can serve to guide analysis methods for machine learning engineers and suggests that neural networks that can exploit the convolution theorem are equally accurate as standard convolutional neural networks, and can be more computationally efficient.

> JavaScript is a popular attack vector for releasing malicious payloads on unsuspecting Internet users. Authors of this malicious JavaScript often employ numerous obfuscation techniques in order to prevent the automatic detection by antivirus and hinder manual analysis by professional malware analysts. Consequently, this paper presents SAFE-Deobs, a JavaScript deobfuscation tool that we have built.   The aim of SAFE-Deobs is to automatically deobfuscate JavaScript malware such that an analyst can more rapidly determine the malicious script's intent. This is achieved through a number of static analyses, inspired by techniques from compiler theory. We demonstrate the utility of SAFE-Deobs through a case study on real-world JavaScript malware, and show that it is a useful addition to a malware analyst's toolset.

> The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to solve cybersecurity problems has been gaining traction within industry and academia, in part as a response to widespread malware attacks on critical systems, such as cloud infrastructures, government offices or hospitals, and the vast amounts of data they generate. AI- and ML-assisted cybersecurity offers data-driven automation that could enable security systems to identify and respond to cyber threats in real time. However, there is currently a shortfall of professionals trained in AI and ML for cybersecurity. Here we address the shortfall by developing lab-intensive modules that enable undergraduate and graduate students to gain fundamental and advanced knowledge in applying AI and ML techniques to real-world datasets to learn about Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), malware analysis, and classification, among other important topics in cybersecurity.   Here we describe six self-contained and adaptive modules in "AI-assisted Malware Analysis." Topics include: (1) CTI and malware attack stages, (2) malware knowledge representation and CTI sharing, (3) malware data collection and feature identification, (4) AI-assisted malware detection, (5) malware classification and attribution, and (6) advanced malware research topics and case studies such as adversarial learning and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) detection.

> New security and privacy concerns arise due to the growing popularity of voice assistant (VA) deployments in home and enterprise networks. A number of past research results have demonstrated how malicious actors can use hidden commands to get VAs to perform certain operations even when a person may be in their vicinity. However, such work has not explored how compromised computers that are close to VAs can leverage the phone channel to exfiltrate data with the help of VAs. After characterizing the communication channel that is set up by commanding a VA to make a call to a phone number, we demonstrate how malware can encode data into audio and send it via the phone channel. Such an attack, which can be crafted remotely, at scale and at low cost, can be used to bypass network defenses that may be deployed against leakage of sensitive data. We use Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency tones to encode arbitrary binary data into audio that can be played over computer speakers and sent through a VA mediated phone channel to a remote system. We show that modest amounts of data can be transmitted with high accuracy with a short phone call lasting a few minutes. This can be done while making the audio nearly inaudible for most people by modulating it with a carrier with frequencies that are near the higher end of the human hearing range. Several factors influence the data transfer rate, including the distance between the computer and the VA, the ambient noise that may be present and the frequency of modulating carrier. With the help of a prototype built by us, we experimentally assess the impact of these factors on data transfer rates and transmission accuracy. Our results show that voice assistants in the vicinity of computers can pose new threats to data stored on such computers. These threats are not addressed by traditional host and network defenses. We briefly discuss possible mitigation ways.

> Malware attacks are a significant part of the new software security threats detected each year. Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) are a set of hardware instructions introduced by Intel in their recent lines of processors that are intended to provide a secure execution environment for user-developed applications. To our knowledge, there was no serious attempt yet to overcome the SGX protection by exploiting the weaknesses in the software supply chain infrastructure, namely at the level of the development, build or signing servers. While SGX protection does not specifically take into consideration such threats, we show in the current paper that a simple malware attack exploiting a separation between the build and signing processes can have a serious damaging impact, practically nullifying SGX integrity protection measures. We also explore two possible mitigations against the attack, one centralized leveraging SGX itself, and one distributed that relies on a smart contract deployed on a blockchain infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that both methods are feasible in practice and their added costs are acceptable for the offered protection.

> Machine learning is rapidly becoming one of the most important technology for malware traffic detection, since the continuous evolution of malware requires a constant adaptation and the ability to generalize. However, network traffic datasets are usually oversized and contain redundant and irrelevant information, and this may dramatically increase the computational cost and decrease the accuracy of most classifiers, with the risk to introduce further noise.   We propose two novel dataset optimization strategies which exploit and combine several state-of-the-art approaches in order to achieve an effective optimization of the network traffic datasets used to train malware detectors. The first approach is a feature selection technique based on mutual information measures and sensibility enhancement. The second is a dimensional reduction technique based autoencoders. Both these approaches have been experimentally applied on the MTA-KDD'19 dataset, and the optimized results evaluated and compared using a Multi Layer Perceptron as machine learning model for malware detection.

> The perpetual opposition between antiviruses and malware leads both parties to evolve continuously. On the one hand, antiviruses put in place solutions that are more and more sophisticated and propose more complex detection techniques in addition to the classic signature analysis. This sophistication leads antiviruses to leave more traces of their presence on the machine they protect. To remain undetected as long as possible, malware can avoid executing within such environments by hunting down the modifications left by the antiviruses. This paper aims at determining the possibilities for malware to detect the antiviruses and then evaluating the efficiency of these techniques on a panel of antiviruses that are the most used nowadays. We then collect samples showing this kind of behavior and propose to evaluate a countermeasure that creates false artifacts, thus forcing malware to evade.

> In recent years, the topic of explainable machine learning (ML) has been extensively researched. Up until now, this research focused on regular ML users use-cases such as debugging a ML model. This paper takes a different posture and show that adversaries can leverage explainable ML to bypass multi-feature types malware classifiers. Previous adversarial attacks against such classifiers only add new features and not modify existing ones to avoid harming the modified malware executable's functionality. Current attacks use a single algorithm that both selects which features to modify and modifies them blindly, treating all features the same. In this paper, we present a different approach. We split the adversarial example generation task into two parts: First we find the importance of all features for a specific sample using explainability algorithms, and then we conduct a feature-specific modification, feature-by-feature. In order to apply our attack in black-box scenarios, we introduce the concept of transferability of explainability, that is, applying explainability algorithms to different classifiers using different features subsets and trained on different datasets still result in a similar subset of important features. We conclude that explainability algorithms can be leveraged by adversaries and thus the advocates of training more interpretable classifiers should consider the trade-off of higher vulnerability of those classifiers to adversarial attacks.

> In this paper, we present a generic, query-efficient black-box attack against API call-based machine learning malware classifiers. We generate adversarial examples by modifying the malware's API call sequences and non-sequential features (printable strings), and these adversarial examples will be misclassified by the target malware classifier without affecting the malware's functionality. In contrast to previous studies, our attack minimizes the number of malware classifier queries required. In addition, in our attack, the attacker must only know the class predicted by the malware classifier; attacker knowledge of the malware classifier's confidence score is optional. We evaluate the attack effectiveness when attacks are performed against a variety of malware classifier architectures, including recurrent neural network (RNN) variants, deep neural networks, support vector machines, and gradient boosted decision trees. Our attack success rate is around 98% when the classifier's confidence score is known and 64% when just the classifier's predicted class is known. We implement four state-of-the-art query-efficient attacks and show that our attack requires fewer queries and less knowledge about the attacked model's architecture than other existing query-efficient attacks, making it practical for attacking cloud-based malware classifiers at a minimal cost.

> Machine learning models have made many decision support systems to be faster, more accurate and more efficient. However, applications of machine learning in network security face more disproportionate threat of active adversarial attacks compared to other domains. This is because machine learning applications in network security such as malware detection, intrusion detection, and spam filtering are by themselves adversarial in nature. In what could be considered an arms race between attackers and defenders, adversaries constantly probe machine learning systems with inputs which are explicitly designed to bypass the system and induce a wrong prediction. In this survey, we first provide a taxonomy of machine learning techniques, styles, and algorithms. We then introduce a classification of machine learning in network security applications. Next, we examine various adversarial attacks against machine learning in network security and introduce two classification approaches for adversarial attacks in network security. First, we classify adversarial attacks in network security based on a taxonomy of network security applications. Secondly, we categorize adversarial attacks in network security into a problem space vs. feature space dimensional classification model. We then analyze the various defenses against adversarial attacks on machine learning-based network security applications. We conclude by introducing an adversarial risk model and evaluate several existing adversarial attacks against machine learning in network security using the risk model. We also identify where each attack classification resides within the adversarial risk model

> Detecting covert channels among legitimate traffic represents a severe challenge due to the high heterogeneity of networks. Therefore, we propose an effective covert channel detection method, based on the analysis of DNS network data passively extracted from a network monitoring system. The framework is based on a machine learning module and on the extraction of specific anomaly indicators able to describe the problem at hand. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (i) the machine learning models encompass network profiles tailored to the network users, and not to the single query events, hence allowing for the creation of behavioral profiles and spotting possible deviations from the normal baseline; (ii) models are created in an unsupervised mode, thus allowing for the identification of zero-days attacks and avoiding the requirement of signatures or heuristics for new variants. The proposed solution has been evaluated over a 15-day-long experimental session with the injection of traffic that covers the most relevant exfiltration and tunneling attacks: all the malicious variants were detected, while producing a low false-positive rate during the same period.

> With the increase of IoT devices and technologies coming into service, Malware has risen as a challenging threat with increased infection rates and levels of sophistication. Without strong security mechanisms, a huge amount of sensitive data is exposed to vulnerabilities, and therefore, easily abused by cybercriminals to perform several illegal activities. Thus, advanced network security mechanisms that are able of performing a real-time traffic analysis and mitigation of malicious traffic are required. To address this challenge, we are proposing a novel IoT malware traffic analysis approach using deep learning and visual representation for faster detection and classification of new malware (zero-day malware). The detection of malicious network traffic in the proposed approach works at the package level, significantly reducing the time of detection with promising results due to the deep learning technologies used. To evaluate our proposed method performance, a dataset is constructed which consists of 1000 pcap files of normal and malware traffic that are collected from different network traffic sources. The experimental results of Residual Neural Network (ResNet50) are very promising, providing a 94.50% accuracy rate for detection of malware traffic.

> Recently, cyber-attacks have been extensively seen due to the everlasting increase of malware in the cyber world. These attacks cause irreversible damage not only to end-users but also to corporate computer systems. Ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya specifically targets to make critical infrastructures such as airports and rendered operational processes inoperable. Hence, it has attracted increasing attention in terms of volume, versatility, and intricacy. The most important feature of this type of malware is that they change shape as they propagate from one computer to another. Since standard signature-based detection software fails to identify this type of malware because they have different characteristics on each contaminated computer. This paper aims at providing an image augmentation enhanced deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models for the detection of malware families in a metamorphic malware environment. The main contributions of the paper's model structure consist of three components, including image generation from malware samples, image augmentation, and the last one is classifying the malware families by using a convolutional neural network model. In the first component, the collected malware samples are converted binary representation to 3-channel images using windowing technique. The second component of the system create the augmented version of the images, and the last component builds a classification model. In this study, five different deep convolutional neural network model for malware family detection is used.

> Targeted phishing emails are on the rise and facilitate the theft of billions of dollars from organizations a year. While malicious signals from attached files or malicious URLs in emails can be detected by conventional malware signatures or machine learning technologies, it is challenging to identify hand-crafted social engineering emails which don't contain any malicious code and don't share word choices with known attacks. To tackle this problem, we fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model by replacing the half of Transformer blocks with simple adapters to efficiently learn sophisticated representations of the syntax and semantics of the natural language. Our Context-Aware network also learns the context representations between email's content and context features from email headers. Our CatBERT(Context-Aware Tiny Bert) achieves a 87% detection rate as compared to DistilBERT, LSTM, and logistic regression baselines which achieve 83%, 79%, and 54% detection rates at false positive rates of 1%, respectively. Our model is also faster than competing transformer approaches and is resilient to adversarial attacks which deliberately replace keywords with typos or synonyms.

> Following a series of high profile miscarriages of justice in the UK linked to questionable expert evidence, the post of the Forensic Science Regulator was created in 2008. The main objective of this role is to improve the standard of practitioner competences and forensic procedures. One of the key strategies deployed to achieve this is the push to incorporate a greater level of scientific conduct in the various fields of forensic practice. Currently there is no statutory requirement for practitioners to become accredited to continue working with the Criminal Justice System of England and Wales. However, the Forensic Science Regulator is lobbying the UK Government to make this mandatory. This paper focuses upon the challenge of incorporating a scientific methodology to digital forensic investigations where malicious software ('malware') has been identified. One aspect of such a methodology is the approach followed to both select and evaluate the tools used to perform dynamic malware analysis during an investigation. Based on the literature, legal, regulatory and practical needs we derive a set of requirements to address this challenge. We present a framework, called the 'Malware Analysis Tool Evaluation Framework' (MATEF), to address this lack of methodology to evaluate software tools used to perform dynamic malware analysis during investigations involving malware and discuss how it meets the derived requirements.

> The Intent in Android plays an important role in inter-process and intra-process communications. The implicit Intent that an application could accept are declared in its manifest and are amongst the easiest feature to extract from an apk. Implicit Intents could even be extracted online and in real-time. So far neither the feasibility of developing an Intrusion Detection System solely on implicit Intent has been explored, nor are any benchmarks available of a malware classifier that is based on implicit Intent alone. We demonstrate that despite Intent is implicit and well declared, it can provide very intuitive insights to distinguish malicious from non-malicious applications. We conducted exhaustive experiments with over 40 different end-to-end Deep Learning configurations of Auto-Encoders and Multi-Layer-Perceptron to create a benchmark for a malware classifier that works exclusively on implicit Intent. Using the results from the experiments we create an intrusion detection system using only the implicit Intents and end-to-end Deep Learning architecture. We obtained an area-under-curve statistic of 0.81, and accuracy of 77.2% along with false-positive-rate of 0.11 on Drebin dataset.

> We designed and developed DOOM (Adversarial-DRL based Opcode level Obfuscator to generate Metamorphic malware), a novel system that uses adversarial deep reinforcement learning to obfuscate malware at the op-code level for the enhancement of IDS. The ultimate goal of DOOM is not to give a potent weapon in the hands of cyber-attackers, but to create defensive-mechanisms against advanced zero-day attacks. Experimental results indicate that the obfuscated malware created by DOOM could effectively mimic multiple-simultaneous zero-day attacks. To the best of our knowledge, DOOM is the first system that could generate obfuscated malware detailed to individual op-code level. DOOM is also the first-ever system to use efficient continuous action control based deep reinforcement learning in the area of malware generation and defense. Experimental results indicate that over 67% of the metamorphic malware generated by DOOM could easily evade detection from even the most potent IDS. This achievement gains significance, as with this, even IDS augment with advanced routing sub-system can be easily evaded by the malware generated by DOOM.

- `2010.10334v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10334v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10334v1)

> The onboarding of IoT devices by authorized users constitutes both a challenge and a necessity in a world, where the number of IoT devices and the tampering attacks against them continuously increase. Commonly used onboarding techniques today include the use of QR codes, pin codes, or serial numbers. These techniques typically do not protect against unauthorized device access-a QR code is physically printed on the device, while a pin code may be included in the device packaging. As a result, any entity that has physical access to a device can onboard it onto their network and, potentially, tamper it (e.g.,install malware on the device). To address this problem, in this paper, we present a framework, called Deep Learning-based Watermarking for authorized IoT onboarding (DLWIoT), featuring a robust and fully automated image watermarking scheme based on deep neural networks. DLWIoT embeds user credentials into carrier images (e.g., QR codes printed on IoT devices), thus enables IoT onboarding only by authorized users. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of DLWIoT, indicating that authorized users can onboard IoT devices with DLWIoT within 2.5-3sec.

> With the growing processing power of computing systems and the increasing availability of massive datasets, machine learning algorithms have led to major breakthroughs in many different areas. This development has influenced computer security, spawning a series of work on learning-based security systems, such as for malware detection, vulnerability discovery, and binary code analysis. Despite great potential, machine learning in security is prone to subtle pitfalls that undermine its performance and render learning-based systems potentially unsuitable for security tasks and practical deployment. In this paper, we look at this problem with critical eyes. First, we identify common pitfalls in the design, implementation, and evaluation of learning-based security systems. We conduct a longitudinal study of 30 papers from top-tier security conferences within the past 10 years, confirming that these pitfalls are widespread in the current security literature. In an empirical analysis, we further demonstrate how individual pitfalls can lead to unrealistic performance and interpretations, obstructing the understanding of the security problem at hand. As a remedy, we derive a list of actionable recommendations to support researchers and our community in avoiding pitfalls, promoting a sound design, development, evaluation, and deployment of learning-based systems for computer security.

> Machine learning-based systems for malware detection operate in a hostile environment. Consequently, adversaries will also target the learning system and use evasion attacks to bypass the detection of malware. In this paper, we outline our learning-based system PEberus that got the first place in the defender challenge of the Microsoft Evasion Competition, resisting a variety of attacks from independent attackers. Our system combines multiple, diverse defenses: we address the semantic gap, use various classification models, and apply a stateful defense. This competition gives us the unique opportunity to examine evasion attacks under a realistic scenario. It also highlights that existing machine learning methods can be hardened against attacks by thoroughly analyzing the attack surface and implementing concepts from adversarial learning. Our defense can serve as an additional baseline in the future to strengthen the research on secure learning.

> Android is the most popular operating system with billions of active devices. Unfortunately, its popularity and openness makes it attractive for unwanted apps, i.e., malware and potentially unwanted programs (PUP). In Android, app installations typically happen via the official and alternative markets, but also via other smaller and less understood alternative distribution vectors such as Web downloads, pay-per-install (PPI) services, backup restoration, bloatware, and IM tools. This work performs a thorough investigation on unwanted app distribution by quantifying and comparing distribution through different vectors. At the core of our measurements are reputation logs of a large security vendor, which include 7.9M apps observed in 12M devices between June and September 2019. As a first step, we measure that between 10% and 24% of users devices encounter at least one unwanted app, and compare the prevalence of malware and PUP. An analysis of the who-installs-who relationships between installers and child apps reveals that the Play market is the main app distribution vector, responsible for 87% of all installs and 67% of unwanted app installs, but it also has the best defenses against unwanted apps. Alternative markets distribute instead 5.7% of all apps, but over 10% of unwanted apps. Bloatware is also a significant unwanted app distribution vector with 6% of those installs. And, backup restoration is an unintentional distribution vector that may even allow unwanted apps to survive users' phone replacement. We estimate unwanted app distribution via PPI to be smaller than on Windows. Finally, we observe that Web downloads are rare, but provide a riskier proposition even compared to alternative markets.

> Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming more frequently used in more applications as the number of connected devices is in a rapid increase. More connected devices result in bigger challenges in terms of scalability, maintainability and most importantly security especially when it comes to 5G networks. The security aspect of IoT devices is an infant field, which is why it is our focus in this paper. Multiple IoT device manufacturers do not consider securing the devices they produce for different reasons like cost reduction or to avoid using energy-harvesting components. Such potentially malicious devices might be exploited by the adversary to do multiple harmful attacks. Therefore, we developed a system that can recognize malicious behavior of a specific IoT node on the network. Through convolutional neural network and monitoring, we were able to provide malware detection for IoT using a central node that can be installed within the network. The achievement shows how such models can be generalized and applied easily to any network while clearing out any stigma regarding deep learning techniques.

> In this work, we present a lightweight IoT botnet detection solution, EDIMA, which is designed to be deployed at the edge gateway installed in home networks and targets early detection of botnets prior to the launch of an attack. EDIMA includes a novel two-stage Machine Learning (ML)-based detector developed specifically for IoT bot detection at the edge gateway. The ML-based bot detector first employs ML algorithms for aggregate traffic classification and subsequently Autocorrelation Function (ACF)-based tests to detect individual bots. The EDIMA architecture also comprises a malware traffic database, a policy engine, a feature extractor and a traffic parser. Performance evaluation results show that EDIMA achieves high bot scanning and bot-CnC traffic detection accuracies with very low false positive rates. The detection performance is also shown to be robust to an increase in the number of IoT devices connected to the edge gateway where EDIMA is deployed. Further, the runtime performance analysis of a Python implementation of EDIMA deployed on a Raspberry Pi reveals low bot detection delays and low RAM consumption. EDIMA is also shown to outperform existing detection techniques for bot scanning traffic and bot-CnC server communication.

> False positives (FPs) have been an issue of extreme importance for anti-virus (AV) systems for decades. As more security vendors turn to machine learning, alert deluge has hit critical mass with over 20% of all alerts resulting in FPs and, in some organizations, the number reaches half of all alerts. This increase has resulted in fatigue, frustration, and, worst of all, neglect from security workers on SOC teams. A foundational cause for FPs is that vendors must build one global system to try and satisfy all customers, but have no method to adjust to individual local environments. This leads to outrageous, albeit technically correct, characterization of their platforms being 99.9% effective. Once these systems are deployed the idiosyncrasies of individual, local environments expose blind spots that lead to FPs and uncertainty.   We propose a strategy for fixing false positives in production after a model has already been deployed. For too long the industry has tried to combat these problems with inefficient, and at times, dangerous allowlist techniques and excessive model retraining which is no longer enough. We propose using a technique called passive-aggressive learning to alter a malware detection model to an individual's environment, eliminating false positives without sharing any customer sensitive information. We will show how to use passive-aggressive learning to solve a collection of notoriously difficult false positives from a production environment without compromising the malware model's accuracy, reducing the total number of FP alerts by an average of 23x.

> The upcoming Internet of things (IoT) is foreseen to encompass massive numbers of connected devices, smart objects, and cyber-physical systems. Due to the large-scale and massive deployment of devices, it is deemed infeasible to safeguard 100% of the devices with state-of-the-art security countermeasures. Hence, large-scale IoT has inevitable loopholes for network intrusion and malware infiltration. Even worse, exploiting the high density of devices and direct wireless connectivity, malware infection can stealthily propagate through susceptible (i.e., unsecured) devices and form an epidemic outbreak without being noticed to security administration. A malware outbreak enables adversaries to compromise large population of devices, which can be exploited to launch versatile cyber and physical malicious attacks. In this context, we utilize spatial firewalls, to safeguard the IoT from malware outbreak. In particular, spatial firewalls are computationally capable devices equipped with state-of-the-art security and anti-malware programs that are spatially deployed across the network to filter the wireless traffic in order to detect and thwart malware propagation. Using tools from percolation theory, we prove that there exists a critical density of spatial firewalls beyond which malware outbreak is impossible. This, in turns, safeguards the IoT from malware epidemics regardless of the infection/treatment rates. To this end, a tractable upper bound for the critical density of spatial firewalls is obtained. Furthermore, we characterize the relative communications ranges of the spatial firewalls and IoT devices to ensure secure network connectivity. The percentage of devices secured by the firewalls is also characterized.

> Encrypted cloud storage services are steadily increasing in popularity, with many commercial solutions currently available. In such solutions, the cloud storage is trusted for data availability, but not for confidentiality. Additionally, the user's device is considered secure, and the user is expected to behave correctly.   We argue that such assumptions are not met in reality: e.g., users routinely forget passwords and fail to make backups, and users' devices get stolen or become infected with malware. Therefore, we consider a more extensive threat model, where users' devices are susceptible to attacks and common human errors are possible. Given this model, we analyze 10 popular commercial services and show that none of them provides good confidentiality and data availability.   Motivated by the lack of adequate solutions in the market, we design a novel scheme called Two-Factor Encryption (2FE) that draws inspiration from two-factor authentication and turns file encryption and decryption into an interactive process where two user devices, like a laptop and a smartphone, must interact. 2FE provides strong confidentiality and availability guarantees, as it withstands compromised cloud storage, one stolen or compromised user device at a time, and various human errors. 2FE achieves this by leveraging secret sharing with additional techniques such as oblivious pseudorandom functions and zero-knowledge proofs. We evaluate 2FE experimentally and show that its performance overhead is small. Finally, we explain how our approach can be adapted to other related use cases such as cryptocurrency wallets.

> Tags can be used by malware repositories and analysis services to enable searches for samples of interest across different dimensions. Automatically extracting tags from AV labels is an efficient approach to categorize and index massive amounts of samples. Recent tools like AVClass and Euphony have demonstrated that, despite their noisy nature, it is possible to extract family names from AV labels. However, beyond the family name, AV labels contain much valuable information such as malware classes, file properties, and behaviors.   This work presents AVClass2, an automatic malware tagging tool that given the AV labels for a potentially massive number of samples, extracts clean tags that categorize the samples. AVClass2 uses, and helps building, an open taxonomy that organizes concepts in AV labels, but is not constrained to a predefined set of tags. To keep itself updated as AV vendors introduce new tags, it provides an update module that automatically identifies new taxonomy entries, as well as tagging and expansion rules that capture relations between tags. We have evaluated AVClass2 on 42M and showed how it enables advanced malware searches and to maintain an updated knowledge base of malware concepts in AV labels.

> Test-time adversarial attacks have posed serious challenges to the robustness of machine-learning models, and in many settings the adversarial perturbation need not be bounded by small $\ell_p$-norms. Motivated by the semantics-preserving attacks in vision and security domain, we investigate $\textit{relational adversaries}$, a broad class of attackers who create adversarial examples that are in a reflexive-transitive closure of a logical relation. We analyze the conditions for robustness and propose $\textit{normalize-and-predict}$ -- a learning framework with provable robustness guarantee. We compare our approach with adversarial training and derive an unified framework that provides benefits of both approaches. Guided by our theoretical findings, we apply our framework to image classification and malware detection. Results of both tasks show that attacks using relational adversaries frequently fool existing models, but our unified framework can significantly enhance their robustness.

> Due to increasing threats from malicious software (malware) in both number and complexity, researchers have developed approaches to automatic detection and classification of malware, instead of analyzing methods for malware files manually in a time-consuming effort. At the same time, malware authors have developed techniques to evade signature-based detection techniques used by antivirus companies. Most recently, deep learning is being used in malware classification to solve this issue. In this paper, we use several convolutional neural network (CNN) models for static malware classification. In particular, we use six deep learning models, three of which are past winners of the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. The other three models are CNN-SVM, GRU-SVM and MLP-SVM, which enhance neural models with support vector machines (SVM). We perform experiments using the Malimg dataset, which has malware images that were converted from Portable Executable malware binaries. The dataset is divided into 25 malware families. Comparisons show that the Inception V3 model achieves a test accuracy of 99.24%, which is better than the accuracy of 98.52% achieved by the current state-of-the-art system called the M-CNN model.

> The performance of a machine learning-based malware classifier depends on the large and updated training set used to induce its model. In order to maintain an up-to-date training set, there is a need to continuously collect benign and malicious files from a wide range of sources, providing an exploitable target to attackers. In this study, we show how an attacker can launch a sophisticated and efficient poisoning attack targeting the dataset used to train a malware classifier. The attacker's ultimate goal is to ensure that the model induced by the poisoned dataset will be unable to detect the attacker's malware yet capable of detecting other malware. As opposed to other poisoning attacks in the malware detection domain, our attack does not focus on malware families but rather on specific malware instances that contain an implanted trigger, reducing the detection rate from 99.23% to 0% depending on the amount of poisoning. We evaluate our attack on the EMBER dataset with a state-of-the-art classifier and malware samples from VirusTotal for end-to-end validation of our work. We propose a comprehensive detection approach that could serve as a future sophisticated defense against this newly discovered severe threat.

> As COVID-19 has been spreading across the world since early 2020, a growing number of malicious campaigns are capitalizing the topic of COVID-19. COVID-19 themed cryptocurrency scams are increasingly popular during the pandemic. However, these newly emerging scams are poorly understood by our community. In this paper, we present the first measurement study of COVID-19 themed cryptocurrency scams. We first create a comprehensive taxonomy of COVID-19 scams by manually analyzing the existing scams reported by users from online resources. Then, we propose a hybrid approach to perform the investigation by: 1) collecting reported scams in the wild; and 2) detecting undisclosed ones based on information collected from suspicious entities (e.g., domains, tweets, etc). We have collected 195 confirmed COVID-19 cryptocurrency scams in total, including 91 token scams, 19 giveaway scams, 9 blackmail scams, 14 crypto malware scams, 9 Ponzi scheme scams, and 53 donation scams. We then identified over 200 blockchain addresses associated with these scams, which lead to at least 330K US dollars in losses from 6,329 victims. For each type of scams, we further investigated the tricks and social engineering techniques they used. To facilitate future research, we have released all the well-labelled scams to the research community.

> Deep learning is a thriving field currently stuffed with many practical applications and active research topics. It allows computers to learn from experience and to understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts, with each being defined through its relations to simpler concepts. Relying on the strong learning capabilities of deep learning, we propose a convolutional generative adversarial network-based (C-GAN) framework titled MalFox, targeting adversarial malware example generation against third-party black-box detectors. MalFox adopts a novel approach to confrontationally produce perturbation paths, with each formed by up to three methods (namely Obfusmal, Stealmal, and Hollowmal) to generate adversarial malware examples via changing the process of program execution in our implementation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MalFox, we collect a large dataset consisting of both malware and benignware, and investigate the performance of MalFox in terms of accuracy, detection rate, and evasive rate of the generated adversarial malware examples. Our evaluation indicates that the accuracy can be as high as 99.01% which significantly outperforms the other 6 well-known learning models. Furthermore, the detection rate is dramatically decreased by 44.3% on average, and the average evasive rate is noticeably improved by up to 55.3%.

> Attacks targeting network infrastructure devices pose a threat to the security of the internet. An attack targeting such devices can affect an entire autonomous system. In recent years, malware such as VPNFilter, Navidade, and SonarDNS has been used to compromise low-cost routers and commit all sorts of cybercrimes from DDoS attacks to ransomware deployments. Routers of the type concerned are used both to provide last-mile access for home users and to manage interdomain routing (BGP). MikroTik is a particular brand of low-cost router. In our previous research, we found more than 4 million MikroTik routers available on the internet. We have shown that these devices are also popular in Internet Exchange infrastructures. Despite their popularity, these devices are known to have numerous vulnerabilities. In this paper, we extend our previous analysis by presenting a long-term investigation of MikroTik-targeted attacks. By using a highly interactive honeypot that we developed, we collected more than 44 million packets over 120 days, from sensors deployed in Australia, Brazil, China, India, the Netherlands, and the United States. The incoming traffic was classified on the basis of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures to detect attacks targeting MikroTik devices. That enabled us to identify a wide range of activities on the system, such as cryptocurrency mining, DNS server redirection, and more than 3,000 successfully established tunnels used for eavesdropping. Although this research focuses on Mikrotik devices, both the methodology and the publicly available scripts can be easily applied to any other type of network device.

> Machine learning based solutions have been very helpful in solving problems that deal with immense amounts of data, such as malware detection and classification. However, deep neural networks have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, or inputs that have been purposefully perturbed to result in an incorrect label. Researchers have shown that this vulnerability can be exploited to create evasive malware samples. However, many proposed attacks do not generate an executable and instead generate a feature vector. To fully understand the impact of adversarial examples on malware detection, we review practical attacks against malware classifiers that generate executable adversarial malware examples. We also discuss current challenges in this area of research, as well as suggestions for improvement and future research directions.

> With the increased deployment of IoT and edge devices into commercial and user networks, these devices have become a new threat vector for malware authors. It is imperative to protect these devices as they become more prevalent in commercial and personal networks. However, due to their limited computational power and storage space, especially in the case of battery-powered devices, it is infeasible to deploy state-of-the-art malware detectors onto these systems. In this work, we propose using and extracting features from Markov matrices constructed from opcode traces as a low cost feature for unobfuscated and obfuscated malware detection. We empirically show that our approach maintains a high detection rate while consuming less power than similar work.

> Identifying threats in a network traffic flow which is encrypted is uniquely challenging. On one hand it is extremely difficult to simply decrypt the traffic due to modern encryption algorithms. On the other hand, passing such an encrypted stream through pattern matching algorithms is useless because encryption ensures there aren't any. Moreover, evaluating such models is also difficult due to lack of labeled benign and malware datasets. Other approaches have tried to tackle this problem by employing observable meta-data gathered from the flow. We try to augment this approach by extending it to a semi-supervised malware classification pipeline using these observable meta-data. To this end, we explore and test different kind of clustering approaches which make use of unique and diverse set of features extracted from this observable meta-data. We also, propose an automated packet data-labeling pipeline to generate ground-truth data which can serve as a base-line to evaluate the classifiers mentioned above in particular, or any other detection model in general.

> With the proliferation of Android malware, the demand for an effective and efficient malware detection system is on the rise. The existing device-end learning based solutions tend to extract limited syntax features (e.g., permissions and API calls) to meet a certain time constraint of mobile devices. However, syntax features lack the semantics which can represent the potential malicious behaviors and further result in more robust model with high accuracy for malware detection. In this paper, we propose an efficient Android malware detection system, named SeqMobile, which adopts behavior-based sequence features and leverages customized deep neural networks on mobile devices instead of the server. Different from the traditional sequence-based approaches on server, to meet the performance demand, SeqMobile accepts three effective performance optimization methods to reduce the time cost. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our system, we conduct experiments from the following aspects 1) the detection accuracy of different recurrent neural networks; 2) the feature extraction performance on different mobile devices, 3) the detection accuracy and prediction time cost of different sequence lengths. The results unveil that SeqMobile can effectively detect malware with high accuracy. Moreover, our performance optimization methods have proven to improve the performance of training and prediction by at least twofold. Additionally, to discover the potential performance optimization from the SOTA TensorFlow model optimization toolkit for our approach, we also provide an evaluation on the toolkit, which can serve as a guidance for other systems leveraging on sequence-based learning approach. Overall, we conclude that our sequence-based approach, together with our performance optimization methods, enable us to detect malware under the performance demands of mobile devices.

> Constructing stealthy malware has gained increasing popularity among cyber attackers to conceal their malicious intent. Nevertheless, the constructed stealthy malware still fails to survive the reverse engineering by security experts. Therefore, this paper modeled a type of malware with an "unbreakable" security attribute-unbreakable malware (UBM), and made a systematical probe into this new type of threat through modeling, method analysis, experiments, evaluation and anti-defense capacity tests. Specifically, we first formalized the definition of UBM and analyzed its security attributes, put forward two core features that are essential for realizing the "unbreakable" security attribute, and their relevant tetrad for evaluation. Then, we worked out and implemented four algorithms for constructing UBM, and verified the "unbreakable" security attribute based on our evaluation of the abovementioned two core features. After that, the four verified algorithms were employed to construct UBM instances, and by analyzing their volume increment and anti-defense capacity, we confirmed real-world applicability of UBM. Finally, to address the new threats incurred by UBM to the cyberspace, this paper explored some possible defense measures, with a view to establishing defense systems against UBM attacks.

> Malware family labels are known to be inconsistent. They are also black-box since they do not represent the capabilities of malware. The current state-of-the-art in malware capability assessment include mostly manual approaches, which are infeasible due to the ever-increasing volume of discovered malware samples. We propose a novel unsupervised machine learning-based method called MalPaCA, which automates capability assessment by clustering the temporal behavior in malware's network traces. MalPaCA provides meaningful behavioral clusters using only 20 packet headers. Behavioral profiles are generated based on the cluster membership of malware's network traces. A Directed Acyclic Graph shows the relationship between malwares according to their overlapping behaviors. The behavioral profiles together with the DAG provide more insightful characterization of malware than current family designations. We also propose a visualization-based evaluation method for the obtained clusters to assist practitioners in understanding the clustering results. We apply MalPaCA on a financial malware dataset collected in the wild that comprises of 1.1k malware samples resulting in 3.6M packets. Our experiments show that (i) MalPaCA successfully identifies capabilities, such as port scans and reuse of Command and Control servers; (ii) It uncovers multiple discrepancies between behavioral clusters and malware family labels; and (iii) It demonstrates the effectiveness of clustering traces using temporal features by producing an error rate of 8.3%, compared to 57.5% obtained from statistical features.

> Authors of malicious software are not hiding as much as one would assume: they have a visible online footprint. Apart from online forums, this footprint appears in software development platforms, where authors create publicly-accessible malware repositories to share and collaborate. With the exception of a few recent efforts, the existence and the dynamics of this community has received surprisingly limited attention. The goal of our work is to analyze this ecosystem of hackers in order to: (a) understand their collaborative patterns, and (b) identify and profile its most influential authors. We develop HackerScope, a systematic approach for analyzing the dynamics of this hacker ecosystem. Leveraging our targeted data collection, we conduct an extensive study of 7389 authors of malware repositories on GitHub, which we combine with their activity on four security forums. From a modeling point of view, we study the ecosystem using three network representations: (a) the author-author network, (b) the author-repository network, and (c) cross-platform egonets. Our analysis leads to the following key observations: (a) the ecosystem is growing at an accelerating rate as the number of new malware authors per year triples every 2 years, (b) it is highly collaborative, more so than the rest of GitHub authors, and (c) it includes influential and professional hackers. We find 30 authors maintain an online "brand" across GitHub and our security forums. Our study is a significant step towards using public online information for understanding the malicious hacker community.

> Malware classification is a difficult problem, to which machine learning methods have been applied for decades. Yet progress has often been slow, in part due to a number of unique difficulties with the task that occur through all stages of the developing a machine learning system: data collection, labeling, feature creation and selection, model selection, and evaluation. In this survey we will review a number of the current methods and challenges related to malware classification, including data collection, feature extraction, and model construction, and evaluation. Our discussion will include thoughts on the constraints that must be considered for machine learning based solutions in this domain, and yet to be tackled problems for which machine learning could also provide a solution. This survey aims to be useful both to cybersecurity practitioners who wish to learn more about how machine learning can be applied to the malware problem, and to give data scientists the necessary background into the challenges in this uniquely complicated space.

> We propose a risk assessment framework for examining the effects of infections with self-replicating malware on military forces engaged in kinetic combat. The framework uses models, in which kinetic combat is represented by a Lanchester model coupled with an SIR-like model describing the malware propagation across the forces. Basic knowledge about the expected circumstances restricts the set of scenarios to be analyzed. Remaining uncertainties are taken into account as random variations given by information-theoretic principles. The risk assessment is realized by Monte-Carlo simulations.   An application of the proposed framework to a simple exemplary situation demonstrates its practicability. The assumed uncertainties about the considered situation lead to a risk value statistics, which changes corresponding to the improving knowledge about the situation. Large uncertainties may lead to results profoundly different from point estimates.

> Ransomware is a kind of malware using cryptographic mechanisms to prevent victims from normal use of their computers. As a result, victims lose the access to their files and desktops unless they pay the ransom to the attackers. By the end of 2019, ransomware attack had caused more than 10 billion dollars of financial loss to enterprises and individuals. In this work, we propose Network-Assisted Approach (NAA), which contains effective local detection and network-level detection mechanisms, to help users determine whether a machine has been infected by ransomware. To evaluate its performance, we built 100 containers in Docker to simulate network scenarios. A hybrid ransomware sample which is close to real-world ransomware is deployed on stimulative infected machines. The experiment results show that our network-level detection mechanisms are separately applicable to WAN and LAN environments for ransomware detection.

> Purpose. This paper examines the Internet security perception of Filipinos to establish a need and sense of urgency on the part of the government to create a culture of cybersecurity for every Filipino. Method. A quantitative survey was conducted through traditional, online, and phone interviews among 252 respondents using a two-page questionnaire that covers basic demographic information and two key elements (1) Internet usage and (2) security practices. Results. Based on findings, there is a sharp increase in Internet users for the last three years (50%), and most access to the Internet through mobile (94.4%). Although at home is the most frequent location for Internet access (94.4%), a good percentage still use free WiFi access points available in malls (22.2%), restaurants (11.1%), and other public areas (38.9%) doing Internet services (email and downloading) that are vulnerable to cyberattacks. The study also revealed that although respondents may have good knowledge of Internet security software, proper implementation is very limited. Conclusion. Filipinos are susceptible to cyberattacks, particularly to phishing and malware attacks. Also, the majority of the respondents' Internet security perception is derivative: they practice online measures but with a limited understanding of the purpose. Therefore proper education, through training and awareness, is an effective approach to remedy the situation. Recommendations. The Philippine government must now take actions and tap industries to educate Filipinos about Internet security before any negative consequences happen in the future. Research Implications. The information collected sets a clear picture of the importance of cybersecurity awareness from a regional to a global perspective.

> Detecting and correctly classifying malicious executables has become one of the major concerns in cyber security, especially because traditional detection systems have become less effective with the increasing number and danger of threats found nowadays. One way to differentiate benign from malicious executables is to leverage on their hexadecimal representation by creating a set of binary features that completely characterise each executable. In this paper we present a novel supervised learning Bayesian nonparametric approach for binary matrices, that provides an effective probabilistic approach for malware detection. Moreover, and due to the model's flexible assumptions, we are able to use it in a multi-class framework where the interest relies in classifying malware into known families. Finally, a generalisation of the model which provides a deeper understanding of the behaviour across groups for each feature is also developed.

> BACKGROUND: Machine learning-based security detection models have become prevalent in modern malware and intrusion detection systems. However, previous studies show that such models are susceptible to adversarial evasion attacks. In this type of attack, inputs (i.e., adversarial examples) are specially crafted by intelligent malicious adversaries, with the aim of being misclassified by existing state-of-the-art models (e.g., deep neural networks). Once the attackers can fool a classifier to think that a malicious input is actually benign, they can render a machine learning-based malware or intrusion detection system ineffective.   GOAL: To help security practitioners and researchers build a more robust model against adversarial evasion attack through the use of ensemble learning.   METHOD: We propose an approach called OMNI, the main idea of which is to explore methods that create an ensemble of "unexpected models"; i.e., models whose control hyperparameters have a large distance to the hyperparameters of an adversary's target model, with which we then make an optimized weighted ensemble prediction.   RESULTS: In studies with five adversarial evasion attacks (FGSM, BIM, JSMA, DeepFool and Carlini-Wagner) on five security datasets (NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS-2017, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CICAndMal2017 and the Contagio PDF dataset), we show that the improvement rate of OMNI's prediction accuracy over attack accuracy is about 53% (median value) across all datasets, with about 18% (median value) loss rate when comparing pre-attack accuracy and OMNI's prediction accuracy.   CONCLUSIONWhen using ensemble learning as a defense method against adversarial evasion attacks, we suggest to create ensemble with unexpected models who are distant from the attacker's expected model (i.e., target model) through methods such as hyperparameter optimization.

> Among many prevailing malware, crypto-ransomware poses a significant threat as it financially extorts affected users by creating denial of access via unauthorized encryption of their documents as well as holding their documents hostage and financially extorting them. This results in millions of dollars of annual losses worldwide. Multiple variants of ransomware are growing in number with capabilities of evasion from many anti-viruses and software-only malware detection schemes that rely on static execution signatures. In this paper, we propose a hardware-assisted scheme, called RanStop, for early detection of crypto-ransomware infection in commodity processors. RanStop leverages the information of hardware performance counters embedded in the performance monitoring unit in modern processors to observe micro-architectural event sets and detects known and unknown crypto-ransomware variants. In this paper, we train a recurrent neural network-based machine learning architecture using long short-term memory (LSTM) model for analyzing micro-architectural events in the hardware domain when executing multiple variants of ransomware as well as benign programs. We create timeseries to develop intrinsic statistical features using the information of related HPCs and improve the detection accuracy of RanStop and reduce noise by via LSTM and global average pooling. As an early detection scheme, RanStop can accurately and quickly identify ransomware within 2ms from the start of the program execution by analyzing HPC information collected for 20 timestamps each 100us apart. This detection time is too early for a ransomware to make any significant damage, if none. Moreover, validation against benign programs with behavioral (sub-routine-centric) similarity with that of a crypto-ransomware shows that RanStop can detect ransomware with an average of 97% accuracy for fifty random trials.

> Today arbitrary synthetic DNA can be ordered online and delivered within several days. In order to regulate both intentional and unintentional generation of dangerous substances, most synthetic gene providers screen DNA orders. A weakness in the Screening Framework Guidance for Providers of Synthetic Double-Stranded DNA allows screening protocols based on this guidance to be circumvented using a generic obfuscation procedure inspired by early malware obfuscation techniques. Furthermore, accessibility and automation of the synthetic gene engineering workflow, combined with insufficient cybersecurity controls, allow malware to interfere with biological processes within the victim's lab, closing the loop with the possibility of an exploit written into a DNA molecule presented by Ney et al. in USENIX Security'17. Here we present an end-to-end cyberbiological attack, in which unwitting biologists may be tricked into generating dangerous substances within their labs. Consequently, despite common biosecurity assumptions, the attacker does not need to have physical contact with the generated substance. The most challenging part of the attack, decoding of the obfuscated DNA, is executed within living cells while using primitive biological operations commonly employed by biologists during in-vivo gene editing. This attack scenario underlines the need to harden the synthetic DNA supply chain with protections against cyberbiological threats. To address these threats we propose an improved screening protocol that takes into account in-vivo gene editing.

> We propose a deep learning approach for identifying malware families using the function call graphs of x86 assembly instructions. Though prior work on static call graph analysis exists, very little involves the application of modern, principled feature learning techniques to the problem. In this paper, we introduce a system utilizing an executable's function call graph where function representations are obtained by way of a recurrent neural network (RNN) autoencoder which maps sequences of x86 instructions into dense, latent vectors. These function embeddings are then modeled as vertices in a graph with edges indicating call dependencies. Capturing rich, node-level representations as well as global, topological properties of an executable file greatly improves malware family detection rates and contributes to a more principled approach to the problem in a way that deliberately avoids tedious feature engineering and domain expertise. We test our approach by performing several experiments on a Microsoft malware classification data set and achieve excellent separation between malware families with a classification accuracy of 99.41%.

> Large software platforms (e.g., mobile app stores, social media, email service providers) must ensure that files on their platform do not contain malicious code. Platform hosts use security tools to analyze those files for potential malware. However, given the expensive runtimes of tools coupled with the large number of exchanged files, platforms are not able to run all tools on every incoming file. Moreover, malicious parties look to find gaps in the coverage of the analysis tools, and exchange files containing malware that exploits these vulnerabilities.   To address this problem, we present a novel approach that models the relationship between malicious parties and the security analyst as a leader-follower Stackelberg security game. To estimate the parameters of our model, we have combined the information from the VirusTotal dataset with the more detailed reports from the National Vulnerability Database. Compared to a set of natural baselines, we show that our model computes an optimal randomization over sets of available security analysis tools.

> Malware detection has become a challenging task due to the increase in the number of malware families. Universal malware detection algorithms that can detect all the malware families are needed to make the whole process feasible. However, the more universal an algorithm is, the higher number of feature dimensions it needs to work with, and that inevitably causes the emerging problem of Curse of Dimensionality (CoD). Besides, it is also difficult to make this solution work due to the real-time behavior of malware analysis. In this paper, we address this problem and aim to propose a feature selection based malware detection algorithm using an evolutionary algorithm that is referred to as Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). The proposed algorithm enables researchers to decrease the feature dimension and as a result, boost the process of malware detection. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

> Package managers have become a vital part of the modern software development process. They allow developers to reuse third-party code, share their own code, minimize their codebase, and simplify the build process. However, recent reports showed that package managers have been abused by attackers to distribute malware, posing significant security risks to developers and end-users. For example, eslint-scope, a package with millions of weekly downloads in Npm, was compromised to steal credentials from developers. To understand the security gaps and the misplaced trust that make recent supply chain attacks possible, we propose a comparative framework to qualitatively assess the functional and security features of package managers for interpreted languages. Based on qualitative assessment, we apply well-known program analysis techniques such as metadata, static, and dynamic analysis to study registry abuse. Our initial efforts found 339 new malicious packages that we reported to the registries for removal. The package manager maintainers confirmed 278 (82%) from the 339 reported packages where three of them had more than 100,000 downloads. For these packages we were issued official CVE numbers to help expedite the removal of these packages from infected victims. We outline the challenges of tailoring program analysis tools to interpreted languages and release our pipeline as a reference point for the community to build on and help in securing the software supply chain.

> As the world becomes more and more interconnected, our everyday objects become part of the Internet of Things, and our lives get more and more mirrored in virtual reality, where every piece of~information, including misinformation, fake news and malware, can spread very fast practically anonymously. To suppress such uncontrolled spread, efficient computer systems and algorithms capable to~track down such malicious information spread have to be developed. Currently, the most effective methods for source localization are based on sensors which provide the times at which they detect the~spread. We investigate the problem of the optimal placement of such sensors in complex networks and propose a new graph measure, called Collective Betweenness, which we compare against four other metrics. Extensive numerical tests are performed on different types of complex networks over the wide ranges of densities of sensors and stochasticities of signal. In these tests, we discovered clear difference in comparative performance of the investigated optimal placement methods between real or scale-free synthetic networks versus narrow degree distribution networks. The former have a clear region for any given method's dominance in contrast to the latter where the performance maps are less homogeneous. We find that while choosing the best method is very network and spread dependent, there are two methods that consistently stand out. High Variance Observers seem to do very well for spread with low stochasticity whereas Collective Betwenness, introduced in this paper, thrives when the spread is highly unpredictable.

> Cybersecurity continues to be a difficult issue for society especially as the number of networked systems grows. Techniques to protect these systems range from rules-based to artificial intelligence-based intrusion detection systems and anti-virus tools. These systems rely upon the information contained in the network packets and download executables to function.

This work demonstrates that side channel information can be used to detect malware running on a computing platform without access to the code involved.

> A common way to get insight into a malicious program's functionality is to look at which API functions it calls. To complicate the reverse engineering of their programs, malware authors deploy API obfuscation techniques, hiding them from analysts' eyes and anti-malware scanners. This problem can be partially addressed by using dynamic analysis; that is, by executing a malware sample in a controlled environment and logging the API calls. However, malware that is aware of virtual machines and sandboxes might terminate without showing any signs of malicious behavior. In this paper, we introduce a static analysis technique allowing generic deobfuscation of Windows API calls. The technique utilizes symbolic execution and hidden Markov models to predict API names from the arguments passed to the API functions. Our best prediction model can correctly identify API names with 87.60% accuracy.

> In this paper, we show that attackers can exfiltrate data from air-gapped computers via Wi-Fi signals. Malware in a compromised air-gapped computer can generate signals in the Wi-Fi frequency bands. The signals are generated through the memory buses - no special hardware is required. Sensitive data can be modulated and secretly exfiltrated on top of the signals. We show that nearby Wi-Fi capable devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops, IoT devices) can intercept these signals, decode them, and send them to the attacker over the Internet. To extract the signals, we utilize the physical layer information exposed by the Wi-Fi chips. We implement the transmitter and receiver and discuss design considerations and implementation details. We evaluate this covert channel in terms of bandwidth and distance and present a set of countermeasures. Our evaluation shows that data can be exfiltrated from air-gapped computers to nearby Wi-Fi receivers located a distance of several meters away.

Recently, deep learning-based static anti-malware detectors have achieved success in identifying unseen attacks without requiring feature engineering and dynamic analysis. However, these detectors are susceptible to malware variants with slight perturbations, known as adversarial examples. Generating effective adversarial examples is useful to reveal the vulnerabilities of such systems. Current methods for launching such attacks require accessing either the specifications of the targeted anti-malware model, the confidence score of the anti-malware response, or dynamic malware analysis, which are either unrealistic or expensive. We propose MalRNN, a novel deep learning-based approach to automatically generate evasive malware variants without any of these restrictions. Our approach features an adversarial example generation process, which learns a language model via a generative sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network to augment malware binaries. MalRNN effectively evades three recent deep learning-based malware detectors and outperforms current benchmark methods. Findings from applying our MalRNN on a real dataset with eight malware categories are discussed.

> The increased reliance on the Internet and the corresponding surge in connectivity demand has led to a significant growth in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The continued deployment of IoT devices has in turn led to an increase in network attacks due to the larger number of potential attack surfaces as illustrated by the recent reports that IoT malware attacks increased by 215.7% from 10.3 million in 2017 to 32.7 million in 2018. This illustrates the increased vulnerability and susceptibility of IoT devices and networks. Therefore, there is a need for proper effective and efficient attack detection and mitigation techniques in such environments. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as one potential solution due to the abundance of data generated and available for IoT devices and networks. Hence, they have significant potential to be adopted for intrusion detection for IoT environments. To that end, this paper proposes an optimized ML-based framework consisting of a combination of Bayesian optimization Gaussian Process (BO-GP) algorithm and decision tree (DT) classification model to detect attacks on IoT devices in an effective and efficient manner. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using the Bot-IoT-2018 dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed optimized framework has a high detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for the detection of botnet attacks in IoT environments.

> Recent works within machine learning have been tackling inputs of ever-increasing size, with cybersecurity presenting sequence classification problems of particularly extreme lengths. In the case of Windows executable malware detection, inputs may exceed $100$ MB, which corresponds to a time series with $T=100,000,000$ steps. To date, the closest approach to handling such a task is MalConv, a convolutional neural network capable of processing up to $T=2,000,000$ steps. The $\mathcal{O}(T)$ memory of CNNs has prevented further application of CNNs to malware. In this work, we develop a new approach to temporal max pooling that makes the required memory invariant to the sequence length $T$. This makes MalConv $116\times$ more memory efficient, and up to $25.8\times$ faster to train on its original dataset, while removing the input length restrictions to MalConv. We re-invest these gains into improving the MalConv architecture by developing a new Global Channel Gating design, giving us an attention mechanism capable of learning feature interactions across 100 million time steps in an efficient manner, a capability lacked by the original MalConv CNN. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/NeuromorphicComputationResearchProgram/MalConv2

> Security of information passing through the Internet is threatened by today's most advanced malware ranging from orchestrated botnets to simpler polymorphic worms. These threats, as examples of zero-day attacks, are able to change their behavior several times in the early phases of their existence to bypass the network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). In fact, even well-designed, and frequently-updated signature-based NIDS cannot detect the zero-day treats due to the lack of an adequate signature database, adaptive to intelligent attacks on the Internet. More importantly, having an NIDS, it should be tested on malicious traffic dataset that not only represents known attacks, but also can to some extent reflect the characteristics of unknown, zero-day attacks. Generating such traffic is identified in the literature as one of the main obstacles for evaluating the effectiveness of NIDS. To address these issues, we introduce RNNIDS that applies Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to find complex patterns in attacks and generate similar ones. In this regard, for the first time, we demonstrate that RNNs are helpful to generate new, unseen mutants of attacks as well as synthetic signatures from the most advanced malware to improve the intrusion detection rate. Besides, to further enhance the design of an NIDS, RNNs can be employed to generate malicious datasets containing, e.g., unseen mutants of a malware. To evaluate the feasibility of our approaches, we conduct extensive experiments by incorporating publicly available datasets, where we show a considerable improvement in the detection rate of an off-the-shelf NIDS (up to 16.67%).

> As the amount of data that needs to be processed in real-time due to recent application developments increase, the need for a new computing paradigm is required. Edge computing resolves this issue by offloading computing resources required by intelligent transportation systems such as the Internet of Vehicles from the cloud closer to the end devices to improve performance however, it is susceptible to security issues that make the transportation systems vulnerable to attackers. In addition to this, there are security issues in transportation technologies that impact the edge computing paradigm as well. This paper presents some of the main security issues and challenges that are present in edge computing, which are Distributed Denial of Service attacks, side channel attacks, malware injection attacks and authentication and authorization attacks, how these impact intelligent transportation systems and research being done to help realize and mitigate these issues.

> Recurrent deep learning language models like the LSTM are often used to provide advanced cyber-defense for high-value assets. The underlying assumption for using LSTM networks for malware-detection is that the op-code sequence of malware could be treated as a (spoken) language representation. There are differences between any spoken-language (sequence of words/sentences) and the machine-language (sequence of op-codes). In this paper, we demonstrate that due to these inherent differences, an LSTM model with its default configuration as tuned for a spoken-language, may not work well to detect malware (using its op-code sequence) unless the network's essential hyper-parameters are tuned appropriately. In the process, we also determine the relative importance of all the different hyper-parameters of an LSTM network as applied to malware detection using their op-code sequence representations. We experimented with different configurations of LSTM networks, and altered hyper-parameters like the embedding-size, number of hidden layers, number of LSTM-units in a hidden layer, pruning/padding-length of the input-vector, activation-function, and batch-size. We discovered that owing to the enhanced complexity of the malware/machine-language, the performance of an LSTM network configured for an Intrusion Detection System, is very sensitive towards the number-of-hidden-layers, input sequence-length, and the choice of the activation-function. Also, for (spoken) language-modeling, the recurrent architectures by-far outperform their non-recurrent counterparts. Therefore, we also assess how sequential DL architectures like the LSTM compare against their non-sequential counterparts like the MLP-DNN for the purpose of malware-detection.

> In the case of malware analysis, categorization of malicious files is an essential part after malware detection. Numerous static and dynamic techniques have been reported so far for categorizing malware. This research presents a deep learning-based malware detection (DLMD) technique based on static methods for classifying different malware families. The proposed DLMD technique uses both the byte and ASM files for feature engineering, thus classifying malware families. First, features are extracted from byte files using two different Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). After that, essential and discriminative opcode features are selected using a wrapper-based mechanism, where Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a classifier. The idea is to construct a hybrid feature space by combining the different feature spaces to overcome the shortcoming of particular feature space and thus, reduce the chances of missing a malware. Finally, the hybrid feature space is used to train a Multilayer Perceptron, which classifies all nine different malware families. Experimental results show that proposed DLMD technique achieves log-loss of 0.09 for ten independent runs. Moreover, the proposed DLMD technique's performance is compared against different classifiers and shows its effectiveness in categorizing malware.

- `2012.08680v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08680v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08680v2)

> Detecting semantically similar functions -- a crucial analysis capability with broad real-world security usages including vulnerability detection, malware lineage, and forensics -- requires understanding function behaviors and intentions. This task is challenging as semantically similar functions can be implemented differently, run on different architectures, and compiled with diverse compiler optimizations or obfuscations. Most existing approaches match functions based on syntactic features without understanding the functions' execution semantics.   We present Trex, a transfer-learning-based framework, to automate learning execution semantics explicitly from functions' micro-traces and transfer the learned knowledge to match semantically similar functions. Our key insight is that these traces can be used to teach an ML model the execution semantics of different sequences of instructions. We thus train the model to learn execution semantics from the functions' micro-traces, without any manual labeling effort. We then develop a novel neural architecture to learn execution semantics from micro-traces, and we finetune the pretrained model to match semantically similar functions.   We evaluate Trex on 1,472,066 function binaries from 13 popular software projects. These functions are from different architectures and compiled with various optimizations and obfuscations. Trex outperforms the state-of-the-art systems by 7.8%, 7.2%, and 14.3% in cross-architecture, optimization, and obfuscation function matching, respectively. Ablation studies show that the pretraining significantly boosts the function matching performance, underscoring the importance of learning execution semantics.

> As an increasing number of deep-learning-based malware scanners have been proposed, the existing evasion techniques, including code obfuscation and polymorphic malware, are found to be less effective. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning-based semantics-preserving (i.e.functionality-preserving) attack against black-box GNNs (GraphNeural Networks) for malware detection. The key factor of adversarial malware generation via semantic Nops insertion is to select the appropriate semanticNopsand their corresponding basic blocks. The proposed attack uses reinforcement learning to automatically make these "how to select" decisions. To evaluate the attack, we have trained two kinds of GNNs with five types(i.e., Backdoor, Trojan-Downloader, Trojan-Ransom, Adware, and Worm) of Windows malware samples and various benign Windows programs. The evaluation results have shown that the proposed attack can achieve a significantly higher evasion rate than three baseline attacks, namely the semantics-preserving random instruction insertion attack, the semantics-preserving accumulative instruction insertion attack, and the semantics-preserving gradient-based instruction insertion attack.

> Despite the enormous amount of data, particular events of interest can still be quite rare. Classification of rare events is a common problem in many domains, such as fraudulent transactions, malware traffic analysis and network intrusion detection. Many studies have been developed for malware detection using machine learning approaches on various datasets, but as far as we know only the MTA-KDD'19 dataset has the peculiarity of updating the representative set of malicious traffic on a daily basis. This daily updating is the added value of the dataset, but it translates into a potential due to the class imbalance problem that the RRw-Optimized MTA-KDD'19 will occur. We capture difficulties of class distribution in real datasets by considering four types of minority class examples: safe, borderline, rare and outliers. In this work, we developed two versions of Generative Silhouette Resampling 1-Nearest Neighbour (G1Nos) oversampling algorithms for dealing with class imbalance problem. The first module of G1Nos algorithms performs a coefficient-based instance selection silhouette identifying the critical threshold of Imbalance Degree. (ID), the second module generates synthetic samples using a SMOTE-like oversampling algorithm. The balancing of the classes is done by our G1Nos algorithms to re-establish the proportions between the two classes of the used dataset. The experimental results show that our oversampling algorithm work better than the other two SOTA methodologies in all the metrics considered.
