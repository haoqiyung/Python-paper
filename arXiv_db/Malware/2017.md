> There are many occasions in which the security community is interested to discover the authorship of malware binaries, either for digital forensics analysis of malware corpora or for thwarting live threats of malware invasion. Such a discovery of authorship might be possible due to stylistic features inherent to software codes written by human programmers. Existing studies of authorship attribution of general purpose software mainly focus on source code, which is typically based on the style of programs and environment. However, those features critically depend on the availability of the program source code, which is usually not the case when dealing with malware binaries. Such program binaries often do not retain many semantic or stylistic features due to the compilation process. Therefore, authorship attribution in the domain of malware binaries based on features and styles that will survive the compilation process is challenging. This paper provides the state of the art in this literature. Further, we analyze the features involved in those techniques. By using a case study, we identify features that can survive the compilation process. Finally, we analyze existing works on binary authorship attribution and study their applicability to real malware binaries.

- *Juan Guarnizo, Amit Tambe, Suman Sankar Bhunia, MartÃ­n Ochoa, Nils Tippenhauer, Asaf Shabtai, Yuval Elovici*

- `1701.02446v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02446v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02446v2)

> In recent years, the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) has led to rising concerns about the security of networked embedded devices. In this work, we focus on the adaptation of Honeypots for improving the security of IoTs. Low-interaction honeypots are used so far in the context of IoT. Such honeypots are limited and easily detectable, and thus, there is a need to find ways how to develop high-interaction, reliable, IoT honeypots that will attract skilled attackers. In this work, we propose the SIPHON architecture - a Scalable high-Interaction Honeypot platform for IoT devices. Our architecture leverages IoT devices that are physically at one location and are connected to the Internet through so-called wormholes distributed around the world. The resulting architecture allows exposing few physical devices over a large number of geographically distributed IP addresses. We demonstrate the proposed architecture in a large scale experiment with 39 wormhole instances in 16 cities in 9 countries. Based on this setup, six physical IP cameras, one NVR and one IP printer are presented as 85 real IoT devices on the Internet, attracting a daily traffic of 700MB for a period of two months. A preliminary analysis of the collected traffic indicates that devices in some cities attracted significantly more traffic than others (ranging from 600 000 incoming TCP connections for the most popular destination to less than 50000 for the least popular). We recorded over 400 brute-force login attempts to the web-interface of our devices using a total of 1826 distinct credentials, from which 11 attempts were successful. Moreover, we noted login attempts to Telnet and SSH ports some of which used credentials found in the recently disclosed Mirai malware.

> This paper investigates and examines the events leading up to the second most devastating data breach in history: the attack on the Target Corporation. It includes a thorough step-by-step analysis of this attack and a comprehensive anatomy of the malware named BlackPOS. Also, this paper provides insight into the legal aspect of cybercrimes, along with a prosecution and sentence example of the well-known TJX case. Furthermore, we point out an urgent need for improving security mechanisms in existing systems of merchants and propose three security guidelines and defenses. Credit card security is discussed at the end of the paper with several best practices given to customers to hide their card information in purchase transactions.

<summary>2017-01-25 14:23:25 - Identifying Key Cyber-Physical Terrain (Extended Version)</summary>

> The high mobility of Army tactical networks, combined with their close proximity to hostile actors, elevates the risks associated with short-range network attacks. The connectivity model for such short range connections under active operations is extremely fluid, and highly dependent upon the physical space within which the element is operating, as well as the patterns of movement within that space. To handle these dependencies, we introduce the notion of "key cyber-physical terrain": locations within an area of operations that allow for effective control over the spread of proximity-dependent malware in a mobile tactical network, even as the elements of that network are in constant motion with an unpredictable pattern of node-to-node connectivity. We provide an analysis of movement models and approximation strategies for finding such critical nodes, and demonstrate via simulation that we can identify such key cyber-physical terrain quickly and effectively.

<summary>2017-02-08 17:21:05 - Learning detectors of malicious web requests for intrusion detection in network traffic</summary>

- *Lukas Machlica, Karel Bartos, Michal Sofka*

- `1702.02530v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02530v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02530v1)

> This paper proposes a generic classification system designed to detect security threats based on the behavior of malware samples. The system relies on statistical features computed from proxy log fields to train detectors using a database of malware samples. The behavior detectors serve as basic reusable building blocks of the multi-level detection architecture. The detectors identify malicious communication exploiting encrypted URL strings and domains generated by a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) which are frequently used in Command and Control (C&C), phishing, and click fraud. Surprisingly, very precise detectors can be built given only a limited amount of information extracted from a single proxy log. This way, the computational requirements of the detectors are kept low which allows for deployment on a wide range of security devices and without depending on traffic context such as DNS logs, Whois records, webpage content, etc. Results on several weeks of live traffic from 100+ companies having 350k+ hosts show correct detection with a precision exceeding 95% of malicious flows, 95% of malicious URLs and 90% of infected hosts. In addition, a comparison with a signature and rule-based solution shows that our system is able to detect significant amount of new threats.

<summary>2017-02-17 07:18:01 - On Ladder Logic Bombs in Industrial Control Systems</summary>

- *Naman Govil, Anand Agrawal, Nils Ole Tippenhauer*

- `1702.05241v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05241v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05241v1)

> In industrial control systems, devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are commonly used to directly interact with sensors and actuators, and perform local automatic control. PLCs run software on two different layers: a) firmware (i.e. the OS) and b) control logic (processing sensor readings to determine control actions). In this work, we discuss ladder logic bombs, i.e. malware written in ladder logic (or one of the other IEC 61131-3-compatible languages). Such malware would be inserted by an attacker into existing control logic on a PLC, and either persistently change the behavior, or wait for specific trigger signals to activate malicious behaviour. For example, the LLB could replace legitimate sensor readings with manipulated values. We see the concept of LLBs as a generalization of attacks such as the Stuxnet attack. We introduce LLBs on an abstract level, and then demonstrate several designs based on real PLC devices in our lab. In particular, we also focus on stealthy LLBs, i.e. LLBs that are hard to detect by human operators manually validating the program running in PLCs. In addition to introducing vulnerabilities on the logic layer, we also discuss countermeasures and we propose two detection techniques.

<summary>2017-02-17 15:32:40 - The Circle Game: Scalable Private Membership Test Using Trusted Hardware</summary>

- *Sandeep Tamrakar, Jian Liu, Andrew Paverd, Jan-Erik Ekberg, Benny Pinkas, N. Asokan*

- `1606.01655v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01655v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01655v4)

> Malware checking is changing from being a local service to a cloud-assisted one where users' devices query a cloud server, which hosts a dictionary of malware signatures, to check if particular applications are potentially malware. Whilst such an architecture gains all the benefits of cloud-based services, it opens up a major privacy concern since the cloud service can infer personal traits of the users based on the lists of applications queried by their devices. Private membership test (PMT) schemes can remove this privacy concern. However, known PMT schemes do not scale well to a large number of simultaneous users and high query arrival rates. We propose a simple PMT approach using a carousel: circling the entire dictionary through trusted hardware on the cloud server. Users communicate with the trusted hardware via secure channels. We show how the carousel approach, using different data structures to represent the dictionary, can be realized on two different commercial hardware security architectures (ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX). We highlight subtle aspects of securely implementing seemingly simple PMT schemes on these architectures. Through extensive experimental analysis, we show that for the malware checking scenario our carousel approach surprisingly outperforms Path ORAM on the same hardware by supporting a much higher query arrival rate while guaranteeing acceptable response latency for individual queries.

<summary>2017-02-19 04:19:11 - DySign: Dynamic Fingerprinting for the Automatic Detection of Android Malware</summary>

- *ElMouatez Billah Karbab, Mourad Debbabi, Saed Alrabaee, Djedjiga Mouheb*

- `1702.05699v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05699v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05699v1)

> The astonishing spread of Android OS, not only in smartphones and tablets but also in IoT devices, makes this operating system a very tempting target for malware threats. Indeed, the latter are expanding at a similar rate. In this respect, malware fingerprints, whether based on cryptographic or fuzzy-hashing, are the first defense line against such attacks. Fuzzy-hashing fingerprints are suitable for capturing malware static features. Moreover, they are more resilient to small changes in the actual static content of malware files. On the other hand, dynamic analysis is another technique for malware detection that uses emulation environments to extract behavioral features of Android malware. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no such fingerprinting technique that leverages dynamic analysis and would act as the first defense against Android malware attacks. In this paper, we address the following question: could we generate effective fingerprints for Android malware through dynamic analysis? To this end, we propose DySign, a novel technique for fingerprinting Android malware's dynamic behaviors. This is achieved through the generation of a digest from the dynamic analysis of a malware sample on existing known malware. It is important to mention that: (i) DySign fingerprints are approximated of the observed behaviors during dynamic analysis so as to achieve resiliency to small changes in the behaviors of future malware variants; (ii) Fingerprint computation is agnostic to the analyzed malware sample or family. DySign leverages state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate the aforementioned fingerprints, which are then leveraged to build an enhanced Android malware detection system with family attribution.

<summary>2017-02-20 14:32:17 - Generating Adversarial Malware Examples for Black-Box Attacks Based on GAN</summary>

- *Weiwei Hu, Ying Tan*

- `1702.05983v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05983v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05983v1)

> Machine learning has been used to detect new malware in recent years, while malware authors have strong motivation to attack such algorithms. Malware authors usually have no access to the detailed structures and parameters of the machine learning models used by malware detection systems, and therefore they can only perform black-box attacks. This paper proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN) based algorithm named MalGAN to generate adversarial malware examples, which are able to bypass black-box machine learning based detection models. MalGAN uses a substitute detector to fit the black-box malware detection system. A generative network is trained to minimize the generated adversarial examples' malicious probabilities predicted by the substitute detector. The superiority of MalGAN over traditional gradient based adversarial example generation algorithms is that MalGAN is able to decrease the detection rate to nearly zero and make the retraining based defensive method against adversarial examples hard to work.

<summary>2017-02-22 09:12:05 - LED-it-GO: Leaking (a lot of) Data from Air-Gapped Computers via the (small) Hard Drive LED</summary>

- *Mordechai Guri, Boris Zadov, Eran Atias, Yuval Elovici*

- `1702.06715v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06715v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06715v1)

> In this paper we present a method which allows attackers to covertly leak data from isolated, air-gapped computers. Our method utilizes the hard disk drive (HDD) activity LED which exists in most of today's desktop PCs, laptops and servers. We show that a malware can indirectly control the HDD LED, turning it on and off rapidly (up to 5800 blinks per second) - a rate that exceeds the visual perception capabilities of humans. Sensitive information can be encoded and leaked over the LED signals, which can then be received remotely by different kinds of cameras and light sensors. Compared to other LED methods, our method is unique, because it is also covert - the HDD activity LED routinely flickers frequently, and therefore the user may not be suspicious to changes in its activity. We discuss attack scenarios and present the necessary technical background regarding the HDD LED and its hardware control. We also present various data modulation methods and describe the implementation of a user-level malware, that doesn't require a kernel component. During the evaluation, we examine the physical characteristics of different colored HDD LEDs (red, blue, and white) and tested different types of receivers: remote cameras, extreme cameras, security cameras, smartphone cameras, drone cameras, and optical sensors. Finally, we discuss hardware and software countermeasures for such a threat. Our experiment shows that sensitive data can be successfully leaked from air-gapped computers via the HDD LED at a maximum bit rate of 4000 bits per second, depending on the type of receiver and its distance from the transmitter. Notably, this speed is 10 times faster than the existing optical covert channels for air-gapped computers. These rates allow fast exfiltration of encryption keys, keystroke logging, and text and binary files.

- *Markus Wagner, Alexander Rind, Niklas ThÃ¼r, Wolfgang Aigner*

- `1612.06232v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06232v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.06232v3)

> IT-security experts engage in behavior-based malware analysis in order to learn about previously unknown samples of malicious software (malware) or malware families. For this, they need to find and categorize suspicious patterns from large collections of execution traces. Currently available systems do not meet the analysts' needs described as: visual access suitable for complex data structures, visual representations appropriate for IT-security experts, provide work flow-specific interaction techniques, and the ability to externalize knowledge in the form of rules to ease analysis and for sharing with colleagues. To close this gap, we designed and developed KAMAS, a knowledge-assisted visualization system for behavior-based malware analysis. KAMAS supports malware analysts with visual analytics and knowledge externalization methods for the analysis process. The paper at hand is a design study that describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of the prototype. We report on the validation of KAMAS by expert reviews, a user study with domain experts, and focus group meetings with analysts from industry. Additionally, we reflect the gained insights of the design study and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the applied visualization methods.

> Fraudulent behaviors in Google Android app market fuel search rank abuse and malware proliferation. We present FairPlay, a novel system that uncovers both malware and search rank fraud apps, by picking out trails that fraudsters leave behind. To identify suspicious apps, FairPlay PCF algorithm correlates review activities and uniquely combines detected review relations with linguistic and behavioral signals gleaned from longitudinal Google Play app data. We contribute a new longitudinal app dataset to the community, which consists of over 87K apps, 2.9M reviews, and 2.4M reviewers, collected over half a year. FairPlay achieves over 95% accuracy in classifying gold standard datasets of malware, fraudulent and legitimate apps. We show that 75% of the identified malware apps engage in search rank fraud. FairPlay discovers hundreds of fraudulent apps that currently evade Google Bouncer detection technology, and reveals a new type of attack campaign, where users are harassed into writing positive reviews, and install and review other apps.

> Malware is constantly evolving. Although existing countermeasures have success in malware detection, corresponding counter-countermeasures are always emerging. In this study, a counter-countermeasure that avoids network-based detection approaches by camouflaging malicious traffic as an innocuous protocol is presented. The approach includes two steps: Traffic format transformation and side-channel massage (SCM). Format transforming encryption (FTE) translates protocol syntax to mimic another innocuous protocol while SCM obscures traffic side-channels. The proposed approach is illustrated by transforming Zeus botnet (Zbot) Command and Control (C&C) traffic into smart grid Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data. The experimental results show that the transformed traffic is identified by Wireshark as synchrophasor protocol, and the transformed protocol fools current side-channel attacks. Moreover, it is shown that a real smart grid Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) accepts the false PMU data.

> Confidently distinguishing a malicious intrusion over a network is an important challenge. Most intrusion detection system evaluations have been performed in a closed set protocol in which only classes seen during training are considered during classification. Thus far, there has been no realistic application in which novel types of behaviors unseen at training -- unknown classes as it were -- must be recognized for manual categorization. This paper comparatively evaluates malware classification using both closed set and open set protocols for intrusion recognition on the KDDCUP'99 dataset. In contrast to much of the previous work, we employ a fine-grained recognition protocol, in which the dataset is loosely open set -- i.e., recognizing individual intrusion types -- e.g., "sendmail", "snmp guess", ..., etc., rather than more general attack categories (e.g., "DoS","Probe","R2L","U2R","Normal"). We also employ two different classifier types -- Gaussian RBF kernel SVMs, which are not theoretically guaranteed to bound open space risk, and W-SVMs, which are theoretically guaranteed to bound open space risk. We find that the W-SVM offers superior performance under the open set regime, particularly as the cost of misclassifying unknown classes at query time (i.e., classes not present in the training set) increases. Results of performance tradeoff with respect to cost of unknown as well as discussion of the ramifications of these findings in an operational setting are presented.

- `1703.05400v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05400v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05400v1)

> The various types of communication technologies and mobility features in Internet of Things (IoT) on the one hand enable fruitful and attractive applications, but on the other hand facilitates malware propagation, thereby raising new challenges on handling IoT-empowered malware for cyber security. Comparing with the malware propagation control scheme in traditional wireless networks where nodes can be directly repaired and secured, in IoT, compromised end devices are difficult to be patched. Alternatively, blocking malware via patching intermediate nodes turns out to be a more feasible and practical solution. Specifically, patching intermediate nodes can effectively prevent the proliferation of malware propagation by securing infrastructure links and limiting malware propagation to local device-to-device dissemination. This article proposes a novel traffic-aware patching scheme to select important intermediate nodes to patch, which applies to the IoT system with limited patching resources and response time constraint. Experiments on real-world trace datasets in IoT networks are conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed traffic-aware patching scheme in alleviating malware propagation.

> Machine learning is increasingly used in security-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, face recognition and malware detection. Most learning methods, however, have not been designed with security in mind and thus are vulnerable to different types of attacks. This problem has motivated the research field of adversarial machine learning that is concerned with attacking and defending learning methods. Concurrently, a different line of research has tackled a very similar problem: In digital watermarking information are embedded in a signal in the presence of an adversary. As a consequence, this research field has also extensively studied techniques for attacking and defending watermarking methods.   The two research communities have worked in parallel so far, unnoticeably developing similar attack and defense strategies. This paper is a first effort to bring these communities together. To this end, we present a unified notation of black-box attacks against machine learning and watermarking that reveals the similarity of both settings. To demonstrate the efficacy of this unified view, we apply concepts from watermarking to machine learning and vice versa. We show that countermeasures from watermarking can mitigate recent model-extraction attacks and, similarly, that techniques for hardening machine learning can fend off oracle attacks against watermarks. Our work provides a conceptual link between two research fields and thereby opens novel directions for improving the security of both, machine learning and digital watermarking.

> Machine learning (ML) models, e.g., deep neural networks (DNNs), are vulnerable to adversarial examples: malicious inputs modified to yield erroneous model outputs, while appearing unmodified to human observers. Potential attacks include having malicious content like malware identified as legitimate or controlling vehicle behavior. Yet, all existing adversarial example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals or its training data. We introduce the first practical demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted DNN with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of our black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the DNN to chosen inputs. Our attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the target DNN, using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the target DNN. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial examples, and find that they are misclassified by the targeted DNN. To perform a real-world and properly-blinded evaluation, we attack a DNN hosted by MetaMind, an online deep learning API. We find that their DNN misclassifies 84.24% of the adversarial examples crafted with our substitute. We demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy to many ML techniques by conducting the same attack against models hosted by Amazon and Google, using logistic regression substitutes. They yield adversarial examples misclassified by Amazon and Google at rates of 96.19% and 88.94%. We also find that this black-box attack strategy is capable of evading defense strategies previously found to make adversarial example crafting harder.

> In technical support scams, cybercriminals attempt to convince users that their machines are infected with malware and are in need of their technical support. In this process, the victims are asked to provide scammers with remote access to their machines, who will then "diagnose the problem", before offering their support services which typically cost hundreds of dollars. Despite their conceptual simplicity, technical support scams are responsible for yearly losses of tens of millions of dollars from everyday users of the web. In this paper, we report on the first systematic study of technical support scams and the call centers hidden behind them. We identify malvertising as a major culprit for exposing users to technical support scams and use it to build an automated system capable of discovering, on a weekly basis, hundreds of phone numbers and domains operated by scammers. By allowing our system to run for more than 8 months we collect a large corpus of technical support scams and use it to provide insights on their prevalence, the abused infrastructure, the illicit profits, and the current evasion attempts of scammers. Finally, by setting up a controlled, IRB-approved, experiment where we interact with 60 different scammers, we experience first-hand their social engineering tactics, while collecting detailed statistics of the entire process. We explain how our findings can be used by law-enforcing agencies and propose technical and educational countermeasures for helping users avoid being victimized by technical support scams.

We include a detailed study of the impact that different price discrimination strategies can have on the success of a ransomware family, examining uniform pricing, optimal price discrimination and bargaining strategies and analysing their advantages and limitations. In addition, we present results of a preliminary survey that can helps in estimating an optimal ransom value. We discuss at each stage whether the different schemes we analyse have been encountered already in existing malware, and the likelihood of them being implemented and becoming successful. We hope this work will help to gain some useful insights for predicting how ransomware may evolve in the future and be better prepared to counter its current and future threat.

> This article presents a proof-of-concept illustrating the feasibility of creating a covert channel between a C\&C server and a malware installed in an organization by exploiting an organization's scanner and using it as a means of interaction. We take advantage of the light sensitivity of a flatbed scanner, using a light source to infiltrate data to an organization. We present an implementation of the method for different purposes (even to trigger a ransomware attack) in various experimental setups using: (1) a laser connected to a stand (2) a laser carried by a drone, and (3) a hijacked smart bulb within the targeted organization from a passing car. In our experiments we were able to infiltrate data using different types of light sources (including infrared light), from a distance of up to 900 meters away from the scanner. We discuss potential counter measures to prevent the attack.

- `1611.05923v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05923v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05923v3)

> There is an especially strong need in modern large-scale data analysis to prioritize samples for manual inspection. For example, the inspection could target important mislabeled samples or key vulnerabilities exploitable by an adversarial attack. In order to solve the "needle in the haystack" problem of which samples to inspect, we develop a new scalable version of Cook's distance, a classical statistical technique for identifying samples which unusually strongly impact the fit of a regression model (and its downstream predictions). In order to scale this technique up to very large and high-dimensional datasets, we introduce a new algorithm which we call "influence sketching." Influence sketching embeds random projections within the influence computation; in particular, the influence score is calculated using the randomly projected pseudo-dataset from the post-convergence Generalized Linear Model (GLM). We validate that influence sketching can reliably and successfully discover influential samples by applying the technique to a malware detection dataset of over 2 million executable files, each represented with almost 100,000 features. For example, we find that randomly deleting approximately 10% of training samples reduces predictive accuracy only slightly from 99.47% to 99.45%, whereas deleting the same number of samples with high influence sketch scores reduces predictive accuracy all the way down to 90.24%. Moreover, we find that influential samples are especially likely to be mislabeled. In the case study, we manually inspect the most influential samples, and find that influence sketching pointed us to new, previously unidentified pieces of malware.

> The Android operating system has become the most popular operating system for smartphones and tablets leading to a rapid rise in malware. Sophisticated Android malware employ detection avoidance techniques in order to hide their malicious activities from analysis tools. These include a wide range of anti-emulator techniques, where the malware programs attempt to hide their malicious activities by detecting the emulator. For this reason, countermeasures against antiemulation are becoming increasingly important in Android malware detection. Analysis and detection based on real devices can alleviate the problems of anti-emulation as well as improve the effectiveness of dynamic analysis. Hence, in this paper we present an investigation of machine learning based malware detection using dynamic analysis on real devices. A tool is implemented to automatically extract dynamic features from Android phones and through several experiments, a comparative analysis of emulator based vs. device based detection by means of several machine learning algorithms is undertaken. Our study shows that several features could be extracted more effectively from the on-device dynamic analysis compared to emulators. It was also found that approximately 24% more apps were successfully analysed on the phone. Furthermore, all of the studied machine learning based detection performed better when applied to features extracted from the on-device dynamic analysis.

<summary>2017-04-08 13:10:50 - A Multi-view Context-aware Approach to Android Malware Detection and Malicious Code Localization</summary>

- *Annamalai Narayanan, Mahinthan Chandramohan, Lihui Chen, Yang Liu*

- `1704.01759v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01759v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.01759v2)

> Existing Android malware detection approaches use a variety of features such as security sensitive APIs, system calls, control-flow structures and information flows in conjunction with Machine Learning classifiers to achieve accurate detection. Each of these feature sets provides a unique semantic perspective (or view) of apps' behaviours with inherent strengths and limitations. Meaning, some views are more amenable to detect certain attacks but may not be suitable to characterise several other attacks. Most of the existing malware detection approaches use only one (or a selected few) of the aforementioned feature sets which prevent them from detecting a vast majority of attacks. Addressing this limitation, we propose MKLDroid, a unified framework that systematically integrates multiple views of apps for performing comprehensive malware detection and malicious code localisation. The rationale is that, while a malware app can disguise itself in some views, disguising in every view while maintaining malicious intent will be much harder.   MKLDroid uses a graph kernel to capture structural and contextual information from apps' dependency graphs and identify malice code patterns in each view. Subsequently, it employs Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to find a weighted combination of the views which yields the best detection accuracy. Besides multi-view learning, MKLDroid's unique and salient trait is its ability to locate fine-grained malice code portions in dependency graphs (e.g., methods/classes). Through our large-scale experiments on several datasets (incl. wild apps), we demonstrate that MKLDroid outperforms three state-of-the-art techniques consistently, in terms of accuracy while maintaining comparable efficiency. In our malicious code localisation experiments on a dataset of repackaged malware, MKLDroid was able to identify all the malice classes with 94% average recall.

> High Energy Physics (HEP) distributed computing infrastructures require automatic tools to monitor, analyze and react to potential security incidents. These tools should collect and inspect data such as resource consumption, logs and sequence of system calls for detecting anomalies that indicate the presence of a malicious agent. They should also be able to perform automated reactions to attacks without administrator intervention. We describe a novel framework that accomplishes these requirements, with a proof of concept implementation for the ALICE experiment at CERN. We show how we achieve a fully virtualized environment that improves the security by isolating services and Jobs without a significant performance impact. We also describe a collected dataset for Machine Learning based Intrusion Prevention and Detection Systems on Grid computing. This dataset is composed of resource consumption measurements (such as CPU, RAM and network traffic), logfiles from operating system services, and system call data collected from production Jobs running in an ALICE Grid test site and a big set of malware. This malware was collected from security research sites. Based on this dataset, we will proceed to develop Machine Learning algorithms able to detect malicious Jobs.

> A growing number of threats to Android phones creates challenges for malware detection. Manually labeling the samples into benign or different malicious families requires tremendous human efforts, while it is comparably easy and cheap to obtain a large amount of unlabeled APKs from various sources. Moreover, the fast-paced evolution of Android malware continuously generates derivative malware families. These families often contain new signatures, which can escape detection when using static analysis. These practical challenges can also cause traditional supervised machine learning algorithms to degrade in performance.   In this paper, we propose a framework that uses model-based semi-supervised (MBSS) classification scheme on the dynamic Android API call logs. The semi-supervised approach efficiently uses the labeled and unlabeled APKs to estimate a finite mixture model of Gaussian distributions via conditional expectation-maximization and efficiently detects malwares during out-of-sample testing. We compare MBSS with the popular malware detection classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), $k$-nearest neighbor (kNN) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Under the ideal classification setting, MBSS has competitive performance with 98\% accuracy and very low false positive rate for in-sample classification. For out-of-sample testing, the out-of-sample test data exhibit similar behavior of retrieving phone information and sending to the network, compared with in-sample training set. When this similarity is strong, MBSS and SVM with linear kernel maintain 90\% detection rate while $k$NN and LDA suffer great performance degradation. When this similarity is slightly weaker, all classifiers degrade in performance, but MBSS still performs significantly better than other classifiers.

> Beyond its highly publicized victories in Go, there have been numerous successful applications of deep learning in information retrieval, computer vision and speech recognition. In cybersecurity, an increasing number of companies have become excited about the potential of deep learning, and have started to use it for various security incidents, the most popular being malware detection. These companies assert that deep learning (DL) could help turn the tide in the battle against malware infections. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial samples, a flaw that plagues most if not all statistical learning models. Recent research has demonstrated that those with malicious intent can easily circumvent deep learning-powered malware detection by exploiting this flaw.   In order to address this problem, previous work has developed various defense mechanisms that either augmenting training data or enhance model's complexity. However, after a thorough analysis of the fundamental flaw in DNNs, we discover that the effectiveness of current defenses is limited and, more importantly, cannot provide theoretical guarantees as to their robustness against adversarial sampled-based attacks. As such, we propose a new adversary resistant technique that obstructs attackers from constructing impactful adversarial samples by randomly nullifying features within samples. In this work, we evaluate our proposed technique against a real world dataset with 14,679 malware variants and 17,399 benign programs. We theoretically validate the robustness of our technique, and empirically show that our technique significantly boosts DNN robustness to adversarial samples while maintaining high accuracy in classification. To demonstrate the general applicability of our proposed method, we also conduct experiments using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, generally used in image recognition research.

> Artificial intelligence methods have often been applied to perform specific functions or tasks in the cyber-defense realm. However, as adversary methods become more complex and difficult to divine, piecemeal efforts to understand cyber-attacks, and malware-based attacks in particular, are not providing sufficient means for malware analysts to understand the past, present and future characteristics of malware.   In this paper, we present the Malware Analysis and Attributed using Genetic Information (MAAGI) system. The underlying idea behind the MAAGI system is that there are strong similarities between malware behavior and biological organism behavior, and applying biologically inspired methods to corpora of malware can help analysts better understand the ecosystem of malware attacks. Due to the sophistication of the malware and the analysis, the MAAGI system relies heavily on artificial intelligence techniques to provide this capability. It has already yielded promising results over its development life, and will hopefully inspire more integration between the artificial intelligence and cyber--defense communities.

> Education and training in digital forensics requires a variety of suitable challenge corpora containing realistic features including regular wear-and-tear, background noise, and the actual digital traces to be discovered during investigation. Typically, the creation of these challenges requires overly arduous effort on the part of the educator to ensure their viability. Once created, the challenge image needs to be stored and distributed to a class for practical training. This storage and distribution step requires significant time and resources and may not even be possible in an online/distance learning scenario due to the data sizes involved. As part of this paper, we introduce a more capable methodology and system as an alternative to current approaches. EviPlant is a system designed for the efficient creation, manipulation, storage and distribution of challenges for digital forensics education and training. The system relies on the initial distribution of base disk images, i.e., images containing solely base operating systems. In order to create challenges for students, educators can boot the base system, emulate the desired activity and perform a "diffing" of resultant image and the base image. This diffing process extracts the modified artefacts and associated metadata and stores them in an "evidence package". Evidence packages can be created for different personae, different wear-and-tear, different emulated crimes, etc., and multiple evidence packages can be distributed to students and integrated into the base images. A number of additional applications in digital forensic challenge creation for tool testing and validation, proficiency testing, and malware analysis are also discussed as a result of using EviPlant.

> To cope with the increasing variability and sophistication of modern attacks, machine learning has been widely adopted as a statistically-sound tool for malware detection. However, its security against well-crafted attacks has not only been recently questioned, but it has been shown that machine learning exhibits inherent vulnerabilities that can be exploited to evade detection at test time. In other words, machine learning itself can be the weakest link in a security system. In this paper, we rely upon a previously-proposed attack framework to categorize potential attack scenarios against learning-based malware detection tools, by modeling attackers with different skills and capabilities. We then define and implement a set of corresponding evasion attacks to thoroughly assess the security of Drebin, an Android malware detector. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a simple and scalable secure-learning paradigm that mitigates the impact of evasion attacks, while only slightly worsening the detection rate in the absence of attack. We finally argue that our secure-learning approach can also be readily applied to other malware detection tasks.

> The proliferation of malwares have been attributed to the alternations of a handful of original malware source codes. The malwares alternated from the same origin share some intrinsic behaviors and form a malware family. Expediently, identifying its malware family when a malware is first seen on the Internet can provide useful clues to mitigate the threat. In this paper, a malware profiler (VMP) is proposed to profile the execution behaviors of a malware by leveraging virtual machine introspection (VMI) technique. The VMP inserts plug-ins inside the virtual machine monitor (VMM) to record the invoked API calls with their input parameters and return values as the profile of malware. In this paper, a popular similarity measurement Jaccard distance and a phylogenetic tree construction method are adopted to discover malware families. The studies of malware profiles show the malwares from a malware family are very similar to each others and distinct from other malware families as well as benign software. This paper also examines VMP against existing anti-malware detection engines and some well-known malware grouping methods to compare the goodness in their malware family constructions. A peer voting approach is proposed and the results show VMP is better than almost all of the compared anti-malware engines, and compatible with the fine tuned text-mining approach and high order N-gram approaches. We also establish a malware profiling website based on VMP for malware research.

> Malware detection is challenging when faced with automatically generated and polymorphic malware, as well as with rootkits, which are exceptionally hard to detect. In an attempt to contribute towards addressing these challenges, we conducted a proof of concept study that explored the use of power consumption for detection of malware presence in a general-purpose computer. The results of our experiments indicate that malware indeed leaves a signal on the power consumption of a general-purpose computer. Specifically, for the case study based on two different rootkits, the data collected at the +12V rails on the motherboard showed the most noticeable increment of the power consumption after the computer was infected. Our future work includes experimenting with more malware examples and workloads, and developing data analytics approach for automatic malware detection based on power consumption.

> This work addresses classification of unknown binaries executed in sandbox by modeling their interaction with system resources (files, mutexes, registry keys and communication with servers over the network) and error messages provided by the operating system, using vocabulary-based method from the multiple instance learning paradigm. It introduces similarities suitable for individual resource types that combined with an approximative clustering method efficiently group the system resources and define features directly from data. This approach effectively removes randomization often employed by malware authors and projects samples into low-dimensional feature space suitable for common classifiers. An extensive comparison to the state of the art on a large corpus of binaries demonstrates that the proposed solution achieves superior results using only a fraction of training samples. Moreover, it makes use of a source of information different than most of the prior art, which increases the diversity of tools detecting the malware, hence making detection evasion more difficult.

> A commonly shared component of antivirus suites is a local database of malware signatures that is used during the static analysis process. Despite possible encryption, heuristic obfuscation, or attempts to hide this database from malicious end-users (or competitors), a currently avoidable eventuality for offline static analysis is a need to use the contents of the database in local computation to detect malicious files. This work serves as a preliminary exploration of the use of concolic execution as a general-case technique for reverse-engineering malware signature database contents: indeed, the existence of a practical technique to such an end would certainly require the use of true (in the sense of provable security) obfuscation in order for malware databases to remain private against capable attackers--a major obstacle given the scarcity of truly practical secure obfuscation constructions. Our work, however, only shows that existing tools (at the time of this report) for concolic execution have severe limitations which prevent the realization of this strategy.

> The Android OS has become the most popular mobile operating system leading to a significant increase in the spread of Android malware. Consequently, several static and dynamic analysis systems have been developed to detect Android malware. With dynamic analysis, efficient test input generation is needed in order to trigger the potential run-time malicious behaviours. Most existing dynamic analysis systems employ random-based input generation methods usually built using the Android Monkey tool. Random-based input generation has several shortcomings including limited code coverage, which motivates us to explore combining it with a state-based method in order to improve efficiency. Hence, in this paper, we present a novel hybrid test input generation approach designed to improve dynamic analysis on real devices. We implemented the hybrid system by integrating a random based tool (Monkey) with a state based tool (DroidBot) in order to improve code coverage and potentially uncover more malicious behaviours. The system is evaluated using 2,444 Android apps containing 1222 benign and 1222 malware samples from the Android malware genome project. Three scenarios, random only, state-based only, and our proposed hybrid approach were investigated to comparatively evaluate their performances. Our study shows that the hybrid approach significantly improved the amount of dynamic features extracted from both benign and malware samples over the state-based and commonly used random test input generation method.

To protect users and business systems new technologies developed by Intel and AMD CPUs may be applied. To deal with the new malware we propose monitoring and controlling access to the memory in real time using Intel VT-x with EPT. We have checked this concept by developing MemoryMonRWX, which is a bare-metal hypervisor. MemoryMonRWX is able to track and trap all types of memory access: read, write, and execute. MemoryMonRWX also has the following competitive advantages: fine-grained analysis, support of multi-core CPUs and 64-bit Windows 10. MemoryMonRWX is able to protect critical kernel memory areas even when PatchGuard has been disabled by malware. Its main innovative features are as follows: guaranteed interception of every memory access, resilience, and low performance degradation.

> Recent researches have shown that machine learning based malware detection algorithms are very vulnerable under the attacks of adversarial examples. These works mainly focused on the detection algorithms which use features with fixed dimension, while some researchers have begun to use recurrent neural networks (RNN) to detect malware based on sequential API features. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to generate sequential adversarial examples, which are used to attack a RNN based malware detection system. It is usually hard for malicious attackers to know the exact structures and weights of the victim RNN. A substitute RNN is trained to approximate the victim RNN. Then we propose a generative RNN to output sequential adversarial examples from the original sequential malware inputs. Experimental results showed that RNN based malware detection algorithms fail to detect most of the generated malicious adversarial examples, which means the proposed model is able to effectively bypass the detection algorithms.

> In this paper we show how attackers can covertly leak data (e.g., encryption keys, passwords and files) from highly secure or air-gapped networks via the row of status LEDs that exists in networking equipment such as LAN switches and routers. Although it is known that some network equipment emanates optical signals correlated with the information being processed by the device ('side-channel'), intentionally controlling the status LEDs to carry any type of data ('covert-channel') has never studied before. A malicious code is executed on the LAN switch or router, allowing full control of the status LEDs. Sensitive data can be encoded and modulated over the blinking of the LEDs. The generated signals can then be recorded by various types of remote cameras and optical sensors. We provide the technical background on the internal architecture of switches and routers (at both the hardware and software level) which enables this type of attack. We also present amplitude and frequency based modulation and encoding schemas, along with a simple transmission protocol. We implement a prototype of an exfiltration malware and discuss its design and implementation. We evaluate this method with a few routers and different types of LEDs. In addition, we tested various receivers including remote cameras, security cameras, smartphone cameras, and optical sensors, and also discuss different detection and prevention countermeasures. Our experiment shows that sensitive data can be covertly leaked via the status LEDs of switches and routers at a bit rates of 10 bit/sec to more than 1Kbit/sec per LED.

> This paper proposes a technique for automatically learning semantic malware signatures for Android from very few samples of a malware family. The key idea underlying our technique is to look for a maximally suspicious common subgraph (MSCS) that is shared between all known instances of a malware family. An MSCS describes the shared functionality between multiple Android applications in terms of inter-component call relations and their semantic metadata (e.g., data-flow properties). Our approach identifies such maximally suspicious common subgraphs by reducing the problem to maximum satisfiability. Once a semantic signature is learned, our approach uses a combination of static analysis and a new approximate signature matching algorithm to determine whether an Android application matches the semantic signature characterizing a given malware family.   We have implemented our approach in a tool called ASTROID and show that it has a number of advantages over state-of-the-art malware detection techniques. First, we compare the semantic malware signatures automatically synthesized by ASTROID with manually-written signatures used in previous work and show that the signatures learned by ASTROID perform better in terms of accuracy as well as precision. Second, we compare ASTROID against two state-of-the-art malware detection tools and demonstrate its advantages in terms of interpretability and accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that ASTROID's approximate signature matching algorithm is resistant to behavioral obfuscation and that it can be used to detect zero-day malware. In particular, we were able to find 22 instances of zero-day malware in Google Play that are not reported as malware by existing tools.

> Security exploits can include cyber threats such as computer programs that can disturb the normal behavior of computer systems (viruses), unsolicited e-mail (spam), malicious software (malware), monitoring software (spyware), attempting to make computer resources unavailable to their intended users (Distributed Denial-of-Service or DDoS attack), the social engineering, and online identity theft (phishing). One such cyber threat, which is particularly dangerous to computer users is phishing. Phishing is well known as online identity theft, which targets to steal victims' sensitive information such as username, password and online banking details. This paper focuses on designing an innovative and gamified approach to educate individuals about phishing attacks. The study asks how one can integrate self-efficacy, which has a co-relation with the user's knowledge, into an anti-phishing educational game to thwart phishing attacks? One of the main reasons would appear to be a lack of user knowledge to prevent from phishing attacks. Therefore, this research investigates the elements that influence (in this case, either conceptual or procedural knowledge or their interaction effect) and then integrate them into an anti-phishing educational game to enhance people's phishing prevention behaviour through their motivation.

> This paper uses a scenario-based role-play experiment based on the usage of QR codes to detect how mobile users respond to social engineering attacks conducted via mobile devices. The results of this experiment outline a guided mobile phone forensics investigation method which could facilitate the work of digital forensics investigators while analysing the data from mobile devices. The behavioural response of users could be impacted by several aspects, such as impulsivity, smartphone usage and security or simply awareness that QR codes could contain malware. The findings indicate that the impulsivity of users is one of the key areas that determine the common mistakes of mobile device users. As a result, an investigative framework for mobile phone forensics is proposed based on the impulsivity and common mistakes of mobile device users. As a result, an investigative framework for mobile phone forensics is proposed based on the impulsivity and common mistakes of mobile device users. It could help the forensics investigators by potentially shortening the time spent on investigation of possible breach scenarios.

> The 2016 is remembered as the year that showed to the world how dangerous Distributed Denial of Service attacks can be. Gauge of the disruptiveness of DDoS attacks is the number of bots involved: the bigger the botnet, the more powerful the attack. This character, along with the increasing availability of connected and insecure IoT devices, makes DDoS and IoT the perfect pair for the malware industry. In this paper we present the main idea behind AntibIoTic, a palliative solution to prevent DDoS attacks perpetrated through IoT devices.

> Sensors (e.g., light, gyroscope, accelerotmeter) and sensing enabled applications on a smart device make the applications more user-friendly and efficient. However, the current permission-based sensor management systems of smart devices only focus on certain sensors and any App can get access to other sensors by just accessing the generic sensor API. In this way, attackers can exploit these sensors in numerous ways: they can extract or leak users' sensitive information, transfer malware, or record or steal sensitive information from other nearby devices. In this paper, we propose 6thSense, a context-aware intrusion detection system which enhances the security of smart devices by observing changes in sensor data for different tasks of users and creating a contextual model to distinguish benign and malicious behavior of sensors. 6thSense utilizes three different Machine Learning-based detection mechanisms (i.e., Markov Chain, Naive Bayes, and LMT) to detect malicious behavior associated with sensors. We implemented 6thSense on a sensor-rich Android smart device (i.e., smartphone) and collected data from typical daily activities of 50 real users. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of 6thSense against three sensor-based threats: (1) a malicious App that can be triggered via a sensor (e.g., light), (2) a malicious App that can leak information via a sensor, and (3) a malicious App that can steal data using sensors. Our extensive evaluations show that the 6thSense framework is an effective and practical approach to defeat growing sensor-based threats with an accuracy above 96% without compromising the normal functionality of the device. Moreover, our framework costs minimal overhead.

> It is well-known that Android malware constantly evolves so as to evade detection. This causes the entire malware population to be non-stationary. Contrary to this fact, most of the prior works on Machine Learning based Android malware detection have assumed that the distribution of the observed malware characteristics (i.e., features) does not change over time. In this work, we address the problem of malware population drift and propose a novel online learning based framework to detect malware, named CASANDRA (Contextaware, Adaptive and Scalable ANDRoid mAlware detector). In order to perform accurate detection, a novel graph kernel that facilitates capturing apps' security-sensitive behaviors along with their context information from dependency graphs is proposed. Besides being accurate and scalable, CASANDRA has specific advantages: i) being adaptive to the evolution in malware features over time ii) explaining the significant features that led to an app's classification as being malicious or benign. In a large-scale comparative analysis, CASANDRA outperforms two state-of-the-art techniques on a benchmark dataset achieving 99.23% F-measure. When evaluated with more than 87,000 apps collected in-the-wild, CASANDRA achieves 89.92% accuracy, outperforming existing techniques by more than 25% in their typical batch learning setting and more than 7% when they are continuously retained, while maintaining comparable efficiency.

> Malwares are becoming persistent by creating full- edged variants of the same or different family. Malwares belonging to same family share same characteristics in their functionality of spreading infections into the victim computer. These similar characteristics among malware families can be taken as a measure for creating a solution that can help in the detection of the malware belonging to particular family. In our approach we have taken the advantage of detecting these malware families by creating the database of these characteristics in the form of n-grams of API sequences. We use various similarity score methods and also extract multiple API sequences to analyze malware effectively.

> Machine learning based system are increasingly being used for sensitive tasks such as security surveillance, guiding autonomous vehicle, taking investment decisions, detecting and blocking network intrusion and malware etc. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models are venerable to attacks by adversaries at all phases of machine learning (eg, training data collection, training, operation). All model classes of machine learning systems can be misled by providing carefully crafted inputs making them wrongly classify inputs. Maliciously created input samples can affect the learning process of a ML system by either slowing down the learning process, or affecting the performance of the learned mode, or causing the system make error(s) only in attacker's planned scenario. Because of these developments, understanding security of machine learning algorithms and systems is emerging as an important research area among computer security and machine learning researchers and practitioners. We present a survey of this emerging area in machine learning.

> Clustering has been well studied for desktop malware analysis as an effective triage method. Conventional similarity-based clustering techniques, however, cannot be immediately applied to Android malware analysis due to the excessive use of third-party libraries in Android application development and the widespread use of repackaging in malware development. We design and implement an Android malware clustering system through iterative mining of malicious payload and checking whether malware samples share the same version of malicious payload. Our system utilizes a hierarchical clustering technique and an efficient bit-vector format to represent Android apps. Experimental results demonstrate that our clustering approach achieves precision of 0.90 and recall of 0.75 for Android Genome malware dataset, and average precision of 0.98 and recall of 0.96 with respect to manually verified ground-truth.

> Over the last decade, malicious software (or malware, for short) has shown an increasing sophistication and proliferation, fueled by a flourishing underground economy, in response to the increasing complexity of modern defense mechanisms. PDF documents are among the major vectors used to convey malware, thanks to the flexibility of their structure and the ability of embedding different kinds of content, ranging from images to JavaScript code. Despite the numerous efforts made by the research and industrial communities, PDF malware is still one of the major threats on the cyber-security landscape. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current attack techniques used to convey PDF malware, and discuss state-of-the-art PDF malware analysis tools that provide valuable support to digital forensic investigations. We finally discuss limitations and open issues of the current defense mechanisms, and sketch some interesting future research directions.

> Remote attestation (RA) is a popular means of detecting malware in embedded and IoT devices. RA is usually realized as an interactive protocol, whereby a trusted party -- verifier -- measures integrity of a potentially compromised remote device -- prover. Early work focused on purely software-based and fully hardware-based techniques, neither of which is ideal for low-end devices. More recent results have yielded hybrid (SW/HW) security architectures comprised of a minimal set of features to support efficient and secure RA on low-end devices.   All prior RA techniques require on-demand operation, i.e, RA is performed in real time. We identify some drawbacks of this general approach in the context of unattended devices: First, it fails to detect mobile malware that enters and leaves the prover between successive RA instances. Second, it requires the prover to engage in a potentially expensive (in terms of time and energy) computation, which can be harmful for critical or real-time devices.   To address these drawbacks, we introduce the concept of self-measurement where a prover device periodically (and securely) measures and records its own software state, based on a pre-established schedule. A possibly untrusted verifier occasionally collects and verifies these measurements. We present the design of a concrete technique called ERASMUS : Efficient Remote Attestation via Self-Measurement for Unattended Settings, justify its features and evaluate its performance. In the process, we also define a new metric -- Quality of Attestation (QoA). We argue that ERASMUS is well-suited for time-sensitive and/or safety-critical applications that are not served well by on-demand RA. Finally, we show that ERASMUS is a promising stepping stone towards handling attestation of multiple devices (i.e., a group or swarm) with high mobility.

> The popularity and widespread usage of online social networks (OSN) have attracted cyber criminals who have used OSNs as a platform to spread malware. Among different types of malware in OSNs, Trojan is the most popular type with hundreds of attacks on OSN users in the past few years. Trojans infecting a user's computer have the ability to steal confidential information, install ransomware and infect other computers in the network. Therefore, it is important to understand propagation dynamics of Trojans in OSNs in order to detect, contain and remove them as early as possible. In this article, we present an analytical model to study propagation characteristics of Trojans and factors that impact their propagation in an online social network. The proposed model assumes all the topological characteristics of real online social networks. Moreover, the model takes into account attacking trends of modern Trojans, the role of anti-virus (AV) products, and security practices of OSN users and AV software providers. By taking into account these factors, the proposed model can accurately and realistically estimate the infection rate caused by a Trojan malware in an OSN as well as the recovery rate of the user population.

> Malware is a pervasive problem in both personal computing devices and distributed computing systems. Identification of malware variants and their families others a great benefit in early detection resulting in a reduction of the analyses time needed. In order to classify malware, most of the current approaches are based on the analysis of the unpacked and unencrypted binaries. However, most of the unpacking solutions in the literature have a low unpacking rate. This results in a low contribution towards the identification of transferred code and re-used code. To develop a new malware analysis solution based on clusters of binary code sections, it is required to focus on increasing of the unpacking rate of malware samples to extend the underlying code database. In this paper, we present a new approach of analysing malware by integrating Ether Unpacker into the plugin-based malware analysis tool, Ragpicker. We also evaluate our approach against real-world malware patterns.

> Behavioral malware detectors promise to expose previously unknown malware and are an important security primitive. However, even the best behavioral detectors suffer from high false positives and negatives. In this paper, we address the challenge of aggregating weak per-device behavioral detectors in noisy communities (i.e., ones that produce alerts at unpredictable rates) into an accurate and robust global anomaly detector (GD).   Our system - Shape GD - combines two insights: Structural: actions such as visiting a website (waterhole attack) or membership in a shared email thread (phishing attack) by nodes correlate well with malware spread, and create dynamic neighborhoods of nodes that were exposed to the same attack vector; and Statistical: feature vectors corresponding to true and false positives of local detectors have markedly different conditional distributions. We use neighborhoods to amplify the transient low-dimensional structure that is latent in high-dimensional feature vectors - but neighborhoods vary unpredictably, and we use shape to extract robust neighborhood-level features that identify infected neighborhoods.   Unlike prior works that aggregate local detectors' alert bitstreams or cluster the feature vectors, Shape GD analyzes the feature vectors that led to local alerts (alert-FVs) to separate true and false positives. Shape GD first filters these alert-FVs into neighborhoods and efficiently maps a neighborhood's alert-FVs' statistical shapes into a scalar score. Shape GD then acts as a neighborhood level anomaly detector - training on benign program traces to learn the ShapeScore of false positive neighborhoods, and classifying neighborhoods with anomalous ShapeScores as malicious.   Shape GD detects malware early (~100 infected nodes in a ~100K node system for waterhole and ~10 of 1000 for phishing) and robustly (with ~100% global TP and ~1% global FP rates).

> In security-sensitive applications, the success of machine learning depends on a thorough vetting of their resistance to adversarial data. In one pertinent, well-motivated attack scenario, an adversary may attempt to evade a deployed system at test time by carefully manipulating attack samples. In this work, we present a simple but effective gradient-based approach that can be exploited to systematically assess the security of several, widely-used classification algorithms against evasion attacks. Following a recently proposed framework for security evaluation, we simulate attack scenarios that exhibit different risk levels for the classifier by increasing the attacker's knowledge of the system and her ability to manipulate attack samples. This gives the classifier designer a better picture of the classifier performance under evasion attacks, and allows him to perform a more informed model selection (or parameter setting). We evaluate our approach on the relevant security task of malware detection in PDF files, and show that such systems can be easily evaded. We also sketch some countermeasures suggested by our analysis.

> Hosting providers play a key role in fighting web compromise, but their ability to prevent abuse is constrained by the security practices of their own customers. {\em Shared} hosting, offers a unique perspective since customers operate under restricted privileges and providers retain more control over configurations. We present the first empirical analysis of the distribution of web security features and software patching practices in shared hosting providers, the influence of providers on these security practices, and their impact on web compromise rates. We construct provider-level features on the global market for shared hosting -- containing 1,259 providers -- by gathering indicators from 442,684 domains. Exploratory factor analysis of 15 indicators identifies four main latent factors that capture security efforts: content security, webmaster security, web infrastructure security and web application security. We confirm, via a fixed-effect regression model, that providers exert significant influence over the latter two factors, which are both related to the software stack in their hosting environment. Finally, by means of GLM regression analysis of these factors on phishing and malware abuse, we show that the four security and software patching factors explain between 10\% and 19\% of the variance in abuse at providers, after controlling for size. For web-application security for instance, we found that when a provider moves from the bottom 10\% to the best-performing 10\%, it would experience 4 times fewer phishing incidents. We show that providers have influence over patch levels--even higher in the stack, where CMSes can run as client-side software--and that this influence is tied to a substantial reduction in abuse levels.

> Learning-based systems have been shown to be vulnerable to evasion through adversarial data manipulation. These attacks have been studied under assumptions that the adversary has certain knowledge of either the target model internals, its training dataset or at least classification scores it assigns to input samples. In this paper, we investigate a much more constrained and realistic attack scenario wherein the target classifier is minimally exposed to the adversary, revealing on its final classification decision (e.g., reject or accept an input sample). Moreover, the adversary can only manipulate malicious samples using a blackbox morpher. That is, the adversary has to evade the target classifier by morphing malicious samples "in the dark". We present a scoring mechanism that can assign a real-value score which reflects evasion progress to each sample based on the limited information available. Leveraging on such scoring mechanism, we propose an evasion method -- EvadeHC -- and evaluate it against two PDF malware detectors, namely PDFRate and Hidost. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed evasion attacks are effective, attaining $100\%$ evasion rate on the evaluation dataset. Interestingly, EvadeHC outperforms the known classifier evasion technique that operates based on classification scores output by the classifiers. Although our evaluations are conducted on PDF malware classifier, the proposed approaches are domain-agnostic and is of wider application to other learning-based systems.

> Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be applied to malware binary detection through images classification. The performance, however, is degraded due to the imbalance of malware families (classes). To mitigate this issue, we propose a simple yet effective weighted softmax loss which can be employed as the final layer of deep CNNs. The original softmax loss is weighted, and the weight value can be determined according to class size. A scaling parameter is also included in computing the weight. Proper selection of this parameter has been studied and an empirical option is given. The weighted loss aims at alleviating the impact of data imbalance in an end-to-end learning fashion. To validate the efficacy, we deploy the proposed weighted loss in a pre-trained deep CNN model and fine-tune it to achieve promising results on malware images classification. Extensive experiments also indicate that the new loss function can fit other typical CNNs with an improved classification performance.

> A number of online services nowadays rely upon machine learning to extract valuable information from data collected in the wild. This exposes learning algorithms to the threat of data poisoning, i.e., a coordinate attack in which a fraction of the training data is controlled by the attacker and manipulated to subvert the learning process. To date, these attacks have been devised only against a limited class of binary learning algorithms, due to the inherent complexity of the gradient-based procedure used to optimize the poisoning points (a.k.a. adversarial training examples). In this work, we rst extend the de nition of poisoning attacks to multiclass problems. We then propose a novel poisoning algorithm based on the idea of back-gradient optimization, i.e., to compute the gradient of interest through automatic di erentiation, while also reversing the learning procedure to drastically reduce the attack complexity. Compared to current poisoning strategies, our approach is able to target a wider class of learning algorithms, trained with gradient- based procedures, including neural networks and deep learning architectures. We empirically evaluate its e ectiveness on several application examples, including spam ltering, malware detection, and handwritten digit recognition. We nally show that, similarly to adversarial test examples, adversarial training examples can also be transferred across di erent learning algorithms.

> Machine-learning techniques are widely used in security-related applications, like spam and malware detection. However, in such settings, they have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, including the deliberate manipulation of data at test time to evade detection. In this work, we focus on the vulnerability of linear classifiers to evasion attacks. This can be considered a relevant problem, as linear classifiers have been increasingly used in embedded systems and mobile devices for their low processing time and memory requirements. We exploit recent findings in robust optimization to investigate the link between regularization and security of linear classifiers, depending on the type of attack. We also analyze the relationship between the sparsity of feature weights, which is desirable for reducing processing cost, and the security of linear classifiers. We further propose a novel octagonal regularizer that allows us to achieve a proper trade-off between them. Finally, we empirically show how this regularizer can improve classifier security and sparsity in real-world application examples including spam and malware detection.

> The vast majority of today's mobile malware targets Android devices. This has pushed the research effort in Android malware analysis in the last years. An important task of malware analysis is the classification of malware samples into known families. Static malware analysis is known to fall short against techniques that change static characteristics of the malware (e.g. code obfuscation), while dynamic analysis has proven effective against such techniques. To the best of our knowledge, the most notable work on Android malware family classification purely based on dynamic analysis is DroidScribe. With respect to DroidScribe, our approach is easier to reproduce. Our methodology only employs publicly available tools, does not require any modification to the emulated environment or Android OS, and can collect data from physical devices. The latter is a key factor, since modern mobile malware can detect the emulated environment and hide their malicious behavior. Our approach relies on resource consumption metrics available from the proc file system. Features are extracted through detrended fluctuation analysis and correlation. Finally, a SVM is employed to classify malware into families. We provide an experimental evaluation on malware samples from the Drebin dataset, where we obtain a classification accuracy of 82%, proving that our methodology achieves an accuracy comparable to that of DroidScribe. Furthermore, we make the software we developed publicly available, to ease the reproducibility of our results.

> We describe a novel approach to monitoring high level behaviors using concepts from AI planning. Our goal is to understand what a program is doing based on its system call trace. This ability is particularly important for detecting malware. We approach this problem by building an abstract model of the operating system using the STRIPS planning language, casting system calls as planning operators. Given a system call trace, we simulate the corresponding operators on our model and by observing the properties of the state reached, we learn about the nature of the original program and its behavior. Thus, unlike most statistical detection methods that focus on syntactic features, our approach is semantic in nature. Therefore, it is more robust against obfuscation techniques used by malware that change the outward appearance of the trace but not its effect. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by evaluating it on actual system call traces.

> Online advertisers and analytics services (or trackers), are constantly tracking users activities as they access web services either through browsers or a mobile apps. Numerous tools such as browser plugins and specialized mobile apps have been proposed to limit intrusive advertisements and prevent tracking on desktop computing and mobile phones. For desktop computing, browser plugins are heavily studied for their usability and efficiency issues, however, tools that block ads and prevent trackers in mobile platforms, have received the least or no attention.   In this paper, we present a first look at 97 Android adblocking apps (or adblockers), extracted from more than 1.5 million apps from Google Play, that promise to block advertisements and analytics services. With our data collection and analysis pipeline of the Android adblockers, we reveal the presences of third-party tracking libraries and sensitive permissions for critical resources on user mobile devices as well as have malware in the source codes. We analyze users' reviews for the in-effectiveness of adblockers in terms of not blocking ads and trackers. We found that a significant fraction of adblockers are not fulfilling their advertised functionality.

> Multi-scanner Antivirus systems provide insightful information on the nature of a suspect application; however there is often a lack of consensus and consistency between different Anti-Virus engines. In this article, we analyze more than 250 thousand malware signatures generated by 61 different Anti-Virus engines after analyzing 82 thousand different Android malware applications. We identify 41 different malware classes grouped into three major categories, namely Adware, Harmful Threats and Unknown or Generic signatures. We further investigate the relationships between such 41 classes using community detection algorithms from graph theory to identify similarities between them; and we finally propose a Structure Equation Model to identify which Anti-Virus engines are more powerful at detecting each macro-category. As an application, we show how such models can help in identifying whether Unknown malware applications are more likely to be of Harmful or Adware type.

> Due to the flexibility, affordability and portability of cloud storage, individuals and companies envisage the cloud storage as one of the preferred storage media nowadays. This attracts the eyes of cyber criminals, since much valuable informa- tion such as user credentials, and private customer records are stored in the cloud. There are many ways for criminals to compromise cloud services; ranging from non-technical attack methods, such as social engineering, to deploying advanced malwares. Therefore, it is vital for cyber forensics examiners to be equipped and informed about best methods for investigation of different cloud platforms. In this chapter, using pCloud (an extensively used online cloud storage service) as a case study, and we elaborate on different kinds of artefacts retrievable during a forensics examination. We carried out our experiments on four different virtual machines running four popular operating systems: a 64 bit Windows 8, Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, Android 4.4.2, and iOS 8.1. Moreover, we examined cloud remnants of two different web browsers: Internet Explorer and Google Chrome on Windows. We believe that our study would promote awareness among digital forensic examiners on how to conduct cloud storage forensics examination.

- `1709.05742v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05742v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.05742v1)

> Infrared (IR) light is invisible to humans, but cameras are optically sensitive to this type of light.   In this paper, we show how attackers can use surveillance cameras and infrared light to establish bi-directional covert communication between the internal networks of organizations and remote attackers. We present two scenarios: exfiltration (leaking data out of the network) and infiltration (sending data into the network). Exfiltration. Surveillance and security cameras are equipped with IR LEDs, which are used for night vision. In the exfiltration scenario, malware within the organization access the surveillance cameras across the local network and controls the IR illumination. Sensitive data such as PIN codes, passwords, and encryption keys are then modulated, encoded, and transmitted over the IR signals. Infiltration. In an infiltration scenario, an attacker standing in a public area (e.g., in the street) uses IR LEDs to transmit hidden signals to the surveillance camera(s). Binary data such as command and control (C&C) and beacon messages are encoded on top of the IR signals. The exfiltration and infiltration can be combined to establish bidirectional, 'air-gap' communication between the compromised network and the attacker. We discuss related work and provide scientific background about this optical channel. We implement a malware prototype and present data modulation schemas and a basic transmission protocol. Our evaluation of the covert channel shows that data can be covertly exfiltrated from an organization at a rate of 20 bit/sec per surveillance camera to a distance of tens of meters away. Data can be covertly infiltrated into an organization at a rate of over 100 bit/sec per surveillance camera from a distance of hundreds of meters to kilometers away.

> Modern malware families often rely on domain-generation algorithms (DGAs) to determine rendezvous points to their command-and-control server. Traditional defence strategies (such as blacklisting domains or IP addresses) are inadequate against such techniques due to the large and continuously changing list of domains produced by these algorithms. This paper demonstrates that a machine learning approach based on recurrent neural networks is able to detect domain names generated by DGAs with high precision. The neural models are estimated on a large training set of domains generated by various malwares. Experimental results show that this data-driven approach can detect malware-generated domain names with a F_1 score of 0.971. To put it differently, the model can automatically detect 93 % of malware-generated domain names for a false positive rate of 1:100.

> With the digital breakthrough, smart phones have become very essential component. Mobile devices are very attractive attack surface for cyber thieves as they hold personal details (accounts, locations, contacts, photos) and have potential capabilities for eavesdropping (with cameras/microphone, wireless connections). Android, being the most popular, is the target of malicious hackers who are trying to use Android app as a tool to break into and control device. Android malware authors use many anti-analysis techniques to hide from analysis tools. Academic researchers and commercial anti-malware companies are putting great effort to detect such malicious apps. They are making use of the combinations of static, dynamic and behavior based analysis techniques. Despite of all the security mechanisms provided by Android, apps can carry out malicious actions through collusion. In collusion malicious functionality is divided across multiple apps. Each participating app accomplish its part and communicate information to another app through Inter Component Communication (ICC). ICC do not require any special permissions. Also, there is no compulsion to inform user about the communication. Each participating app needs to request a minimal set of privileges, which may make it appear benign to current state-of-the-art techniques that analyze one app at a time. There are many surveys on app analysis techniques in Android; however they focus on single-app analysis. This survey augments this through focusing only on collusion among multiple-apps. In this paper, we present Android vulnerabilities that may be exploited for a possible collusion attack. We cover the existing threat analysis, scenarios, and a detailed comparison of tools for intra and inter-app analysis. To the best of our knowledge this is the first survey on app collusion and state-of-the-art detection tools in Android.

> Word embedding is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that automatically maps words from a vocabulary to vectors of real numbers in an embedding space. It has been widely used in recent years to boost the performance of a vari-ety of NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition, Syntac-tic Parsing and Sentiment Analysis. Classic word embedding methods such as Word2Vec and GloVe work well when they are given a large text corpus. When the input texts are sparse as in many specialized domains (e.g., cybersecurity), these methods often fail to produce high-quality vectors. In this pa-per, we describe a novel method to train domain-specificword embeddings from sparse texts. In addition to domain texts, our method also leverages diverse types of domain knowledge such as domain vocabulary and semantic relations. Specifi-cally, we first propose a general framework to encode diverse types of domain knowledge as text annotations. Then we de-velop a novel Word Annotation Embedding (WAE) algorithm to incorporate diverse types of text annotations in word em-bedding. We have evaluated our method on two cybersecurity text corpora: a malware description corpus and a Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) corpus. Our evaluation re-sults have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in learning domain-specific word embeddings.

> Deep learning (DL) systems are increasingly deployed in safety- and security-critical domains including self-driving cars and malware detection, where the correctness and predictability of a system's behavior for corner case inputs are of great importance. Existing DL testing depends heavily on manually labeled data and therefore often fails to expose erroneous behaviors for rare inputs.   We design, implement, and evaluate DeepXplore, the first whitebox framework for systematically testing real-world DL systems. First, we introduce neuron coverage for systematically measuring the parts of a DL system exercised by test inputs. Next, we leverage multiple DL systems with similar functionality as cross-referencing oracles to avoid manual checking. Finally, we demonstrate how finding inputs for DL systems that both trigger many differential behaviors and achieve high neuron coverage can be represented as a joint optimization problem and solved efficiently using gradient-based search techniques.   DeepXplore efficiently finds thousands of incorrect corner case behaviors (e.g., self-driving cars crashing into guard rails and malware masquerading as benign software) in state-of-the-art DL models with thousands of neurons trained on five popular datasets including ImageNet and Udacity self-driving challenge data. For all tested DL models, on average, DeepXplore generated one test input demonstrating incorrect behavior within one second while running only on a commodity laptop. We further show that the test inputs generated by DeepXplore can also be used to retrain the corresponding DL model to improve the model's accuracy by up to 3%.

> Ransomware, a class of self-propagating malware that uses encryption to hold the victims' data ransom, has emerged in recent years as one of the most dangerous cyber threats, with widespread damage; e.g., zero-day ransomware WannaCry has caused world-wide catastrophe, from knocking U.K. National Health Service hospitals offline to shutting down a Honda Motor Company in Japan[1]. Our close collaboration with security operations of large enterprises reveals that defense against ransomware relies on tedious analysis from high-volume systems logs of the first few infections. Sandbox analysis of freshly captured malware is also commonplace in operation.   We introduce a method to identify and rank the most discriminating ransomware features from a set of ambient (non-attack) system logs and at least one log stream containing both ambient and ransomware behavior. These ranked features reveal a set of malware actions that are produced automatically from system logs, and can help automate tedious manual analysis. We test our approach using WannaCry and two polymorphic samples by producing logs with Cuckoo Sandbox during both ambient, and ambient plus ransomware executions. Our goal is to extract the features of the malware from the logs with only knowledge that malware was present. We compare outputs with a detailed analysis of WannaCry allowing validation of the algorithm's feature extraction and provide analysis of the method's robustness to variations of input data\textemdash changing quality/quantity of ambient data and testing polymorphic ransomware. Most notably, our patterns are accurate and unwavering when generated from polymorphic WannaCry copies, on which 63 (of 63 tested) anti-virus (AV) products fail.

> Static detection technologies based on signature-based approaches that are widely used in Android platform to detect malicious applications. It can accurately detect malware by extracting signatures from test data and then comparing the test data with the signature samples of virus and benign samples. However, this method is generally unable to detect unknown malware applications. This is because, sometimes, the machine code can be converted into assembly code, which can be easily read and understood by humans. Furthuremore, the attacker can then make sense of the assembly instructions and understand the functioning of the program from the same. Therefore we focus on observing the behaviour of the malicious software while it is actually running on a host system. The dynamic behaviours of an application are conducted by the system call sequences at the end. Hence, we observe the system call log of each application, use the same for the construction of our dataset, and finally use this dataset to classify an unknown application as malicious or benign.

> The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that can tremendously revolutionize health care thus benefiting both hospitals, doctors and patients. In this context, protecting the IoT in health care against interference, including service attacks and malwares, is challenging. Opacity is a confidentiality property capturing a system's ability to keep a subset of its behavior hidden from passive observers. In this work, we seek to introduce an IoT-based heart attack detection system, that could be life-saving for patients without risking their need for privacy through the verification and enforcement of opacity. Our main contributions are the use of a tool to verify opacity in three of its forms, so as to detect privacy leaks in our system. Furthermore, we develop an efficient, Symbolic Observation Graph (SOG)-based algorithm for enforcing opacity.

> Malware lineage studies the evolutionary relationships among malware and has important applications for malware analysis. A persistent limitation of prior malware lineage approaches is to consider every input sample a separate malware version. This is problematic since a majority of malware are packed and the packing process produces many polymorphic variants (i.e., executables with different file hash) of the same malware version. Thus, many samples correspond to the same malware version and it is challenging to identify distinct malware versions from polymorphic variants. This problem does not manifest in prior malware lineage approaches because they work on synthetic malware, malware that are not packed, or packed malware for which unpackers are available. In this work, we propose a novel malware lineage approach that works on malware samples collected in the wild. Given a set of malware executables from the same family, for which no source code is available and which may be packed, our approach produces a lineage graph where nodes are versions of the family and edges describe the relationships between versions. To enable our malware lineage approach, we propose the first technique to identify the versions of a malware family and a scalable code indexing technique for determining shared functions between any pair of input samples. We have evaluated the accuracy of our approach on 13 open-source programs and have applied it to produce lineage graphs for 10 popular malware families. Our malware lineage graphs achieve on average a 26 times reduction from number of input samples to number of versions.

> While the Internet of things (IoT) promises to improve areas such as energy efficiency, health care, and transportation, it is highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. In particular, DDoS attacks work by overflowing the bandwidth of a server. But many IoT devices form part of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Therefore, they can be used to launch a "physical" denial-of-service attack (PDoS) in which IoT devices overflow the "physical bandwidth" of a CPS. In this paper, we quantify the population-based risk to a group of IoT devices targeted by malware for a PDoS attack. To model the recruitment of bots, we extend a traditional game-theoretic concept and create a "Poisson signaling game." Then we analyze two different mechanisms (legal and economic) to deter botnet recruitment. We find that 1) defenders can bound botnet activity and 2) legislating a minimum level of security has only a limited effect, while incentivizing active defense can decrease botnet activity arbitrarily. This work provides a quantitative foundation for designing proactive defense against PDoS attacks.

> Machine Learning (ML) models are applied in a variety of tasks such as network intrusion detection or Malware classification. Yet, these models are vulnerable to a class of malicious inputs known as adversarial examples. These are slightly perturbed inputs that are classified incorrectly by the ML model. The mitigation of these adversarial inputs remains an open problem. As a step towards understanding adversarial examples, we show that they are not drawn from the same distribution than the original data, and can thus be detected using statistical tests. Using thus knowledge, we introduce a complimentary approach to identify specific inputs that are adversarial. Specifically, we augment our ML model with an additional output, in which the model is trained to classify all adversarial inputs. We evaluate our approach on multiple adversarial example crafting methods (including the fast gradient sign and saliency map methods) with several datasets. The statistical test flags sample sets containing adversarial inputs confidently at sample sizes between 10 and 100 data points. Furthermore, our augmented model either detects adversarial examples as outliers with high accuracy (> 80%) or increases the adversary's cost - the perturbation added - by more than 150%. In this way, we show that statistical properties of adversarial examples are essential to their detection.

> In this work we introduce malware detection from raw byte sequences as a fruitful research area to the larger machine learning community. Building a neural network for such a problem presents a number of interesting challenges that have not occurred in tasks such as image processing or NLP. In particular, we note that detection from raw bytes presents a sequence problem with over two million time steps and a problem where batch normalization appear to hinder the learning process. We present our initial work in building a solution to tackle this problem, which has linear complexity dependence on the sequence length, and allows for interpretable sub-regions of the binary to be identified. In doing so we will discuss the many challenges in building a neural network to process data at this scale, and the methods we used to work around them.

> The evolution of mobile malware poses a serious threat to smartphone security. Today, sophisticated attackers can adapt by maximally sabotaging machine-learning classifiers via polluting training data, rendering most recent machine learning-based malware detection tools (such as Drebin, DroidAPIMiner, and MaMaDroid) ineffective. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of constructing crafted malware samples; examine how machine-learning classifiers can be misled under three different threat models; then conclude that injecting carefully crafted data into training data can significantly reduce detection accuracy. To tackle the problem, we propose KuafuDet, a two-phase learning enhancing approach that learns mobile malware by adversarial detection. KuafuDet includes an offline training phase that selects and extracts features from the training set, and an online detection phase that utilizes the classifier trained by the first phase. To further address the adversarial environment, these two phases are intertwined through a self-adaptive learning scheme, wherein an automated camouflage detector is introduced to filter the suspicious false negatives and feed them back into the training phase. We finally show that KuafuDet can significantly reduce false negatives and boost the detection accuracy by at least 15%. Experiments on more than 250,000 mobile applications demonstrate that KuafuDet is scalable and can be highly effective as a standalone system.

The detection engine aims to classify Portable Executable (PE) files as malicious or benign. File classification is carried out using a deep belief neural network (DBN) as the detection engine. Our approach is to model the files as grayscale images and use the DBN to classify those images into the aforementioned two classes. An extensive data set of 10,000 files is used to train the DBN. Validation is carried out using 4,000 files previously unexposed to the network. The final result of whether to allow or block a file is obtained by arriving at a proof of work based consensus in the blockchain network.

Tested on malware classification, it significantly outperforms current state of the art. We provide a series of performance measures and tests to demonstrate the capabilities, including measurements from production use. We show how the system scales linearly with the number of endpoints. With the system we estimate the total number of malware families created over the last 10 years as 3450, in line with reasonable economic constraints. The more limited rate for new malware families than previously acknowledged implies that machine learning malware classifiers risk being tested on their training set; we achieve F1 = 0.995 in a test carefully designed to mitigate this risk.

Early in 2002, Loughry et al studied the exfiltration of LED indicators and found the kind of LEDs unmodulated to indicate some state of the device can hardly be utilized to establish covert channels. In our paper, a novel approach is proposed to modulate this kind of LEDs. We use binary frequency shift keying(B-FSK) to replace on-off keying(OOK) in modulation. In order to verify the validity, we implement a prototype of an exfiltration malware. Our experiment show a great improvement in the imperceptibility of covert communication. It is available to leak data covertly from air-gapped networks via unmodulated LED status indicators.

> Many efforts have been made to use various forms of domain knowledge in malware detection. Currently there exist two common approaches to malware detection without domain knowledge, namely byte n-grams and strings. In this work we explore the feasibility of applying neural networks to malware detection and feature learning. We do this by restricting ourselves to a minimal amount of domain knowledge in order to extract a portion of the Portable Executable (PE) header. By doing this we show that neural networks can learn from raw bytes without explicit feature construction, and perform even better than a domain knowledge approach that parses the PE header into explicit features.

> A recent report indicates that there is a new malicious app introduced every 4 seconds. This rapid malware distribution rate causes existing malware detection systems to fall far behind, allowing malicious apps to escape vetting efforts and be distributed by even legitimate app stores. When trusted downloading sites distribute malware, several negative consequences ensue. First, the popularity of these sites would allow such malicious apps to quickly and widely infect devices. Second, analysts and researchers who rely on machine learning based detection techniques may also download these apps and mistakenly label them as benign since they have not been disclosed as malware. These apps are then used as part of their benign dataset during model training and testing. The presence of contaminants in benign dataset can compromise the effectiveness and accuracy of their detection and classification techniques. To address this issue, we introduce PUDROID (Positive and Unlabeled learning-based malware detection for Android) to automatically and effectively remove contaminants from training datasets, allowing machine learning based malware classifiers and detectors to be more effective and accurate. To further improve the performance of such detectors, we apply a feature selection strategy to select pertinent features from a variety of features. We then compare the detection rates and accuracy of detection systems using two datasets; one using PUDROID to remove contaminants and the other without removing contaminants. The results indicate that once we remove contaminants from the datasets, we can significantly improve both malware detection rate and detection accuracy

> Widespread growth in Android malwares stimulates security researchers to propose different methods for analyzing and detecting malicious behaviors in applications. Nevertheless, current solutions are ill-suited to extract the fine-grained behavior of Android applications accurately and efficiently. In this paper, we propose ServiceMonitor, a lightweight host-based detection system that dynamically detects malicious applications directly on mobile devices. ServiceMonitor reconstructs the fine-grained behavior of applications based on a novel systematic system service use analysis technique. Using proposed system service use perspective enables us to build a statistical Markov chain model to represent what and how system services are used to access system resources. Afterwards, we consider built Markov chain in the form of a feature vector and use it to classify the application behavior into either malicious or benign using Random Forests classification algorithm. ServiceMonitor outperforms current host-based solutions with evaluating it against 4034 malwares and 10024 benign applications and obtaining 96\% of accuracy rate and negligible overhead and performance penalty.

> Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in many tasks of machine learning, such as the image classification. Unfortunately, researchers have shown that DNNs are easily attacked by adversarial examples, slightly perturbed images which can mislead DNNs to give incorrect classification results. Such attack has seriously hampered the deployment of DNN systems in areas where security or safety requirements are strict, such as autonomous cars, face recognition, malware detection. Defensive distillation is a mechanism aimed at training a robust DNN which significantly reduces the effectiveness of adversarial examples generation. However, the state-of-the-art attack can be successful on distilled networks with 100% probability. But it is a white-box attack which needs to know the inner information of DNN. Whereas, the black-box scenario is more general. In this paper, we first propose the epsilon-neighborhood attack, which can fool the defensively distilled networks with 100% success rate in the white-box setting, and it is fast to generate adversarial examples with good visual quality. On the basis of this attack, we further propose the region-based attack against defensively distilled DNNs in the black-box setting. And we also perform the bypass attack to indirectly break the distillation defense as a complementary method. The experimental results show that our black-box attacks have a considerable success rate on defensively distilled networks.

> The rise in popularity of the Android platform has resulted in an explosion of malware threats targeting it. As both Android malware and the operating system itself constantly evolve, it is very challenging to design robust malware mitigation techniques that can operate for long periods of time without the need for modifications or costly re-training. In this paper, we present MaMaDroid, an Android malware detection system that relies on app behavior. MaMaDroid builds a behavioral model, in the form of a Markov chain, from the sequence of abstracted API calls performed by an app, and uses it to extract features and perform classification. By abstracting calls to their packages or families, MaMaDroid maintains resilience to API changes and keeps the feature set size manageable. We evaluate its accuracy on a dataset of 8.5K benign and 35.5K malicious apps collected over a period of six years, showing that it not only effectively detects malware (with up to 99% F-measure), but also that the model built by the system keeps its detection capabilities for long periods of time (on average, 86% and 75% F-measure, respectively, one and two years after training). Finally, we compare against DroidAPIMiner, a state-of-the-art system that relies on the frequency of API calls performed by apps, showing that MaMaDroid significantly outperforms it.

> Data driven research on Android has gained a great momentum these years. The abundance of data facilitates knowledge learning, however, also increases the difficulty of data preprocessing. Therefore, it is non-trivial to prepare a demanding and accurate set of data for research. In this work, we put forward AndroVault, a framework for the Android research composing of data collection, knowledge representation and knowledge extraction. It has started with a long-running web crawler for data collection (both apps and description) since 2013, which guarantees the timeliness of data; With static analysis and dynamic analysis of the collected data, we compute a variety of attributes to characterize Android apps. After that, we employ a knowledge graph to connect all these apps by computing their correlation in terms of attributes; Last, we leverage multiple technologies such as logical inference, machine learning, and correlation analysis to extract facts (more accurate and demanding, either high level or not, data) that are beneficial for a specific research problem. With the produced data of high quality, we have successfully conducted many research works including malware detection, code generation, and Android testing. We would like to release our data to the research community in an authenticated manner, and encourage them to conduct productive research.

> This paper presents a novel deep learning based method for automatic malware signature generation and classification. The method uses a deep belief network (DBN), implemented with a deep stack of denoising autoencoders, generating an invariant compact representation of the malware behavior. While conventional signature and token based methods for malware detection do not detect a majority of new variants for existing malware, the results presented in this paper show that signatures generated by the DBN allow for an accurate classification of new malware variants. Using a dataset containing hundreds of variants for several major malware families, our method achieves 98.6% classification accuracy using the signatures generated by the DBN. The presented method is completely agnostic to the type of malware behavior that is logged (e.g., API calls and their parameters, registry entries, websites and ports accessed, etc.), and can use any raw input from a sandbox to successfully train the deep neural network which is used to generate malware signatures.

> In recent years numerous advanced malware, aka advanced persistent threats (APT) are allegedly developed by nation-states. The task of attributing an APT to a specific nation-state is extremely challenging for several reasons. Each nation-state has usually more than a single cyber unit that develops such advanced malware, rendering traditional authorship attribution algorithms useless. Furthermore, those APTs use state-of-the-art evasion techniques, making feature extraction challenging. Finally, the dataset of such available APTs is extremely small.   In this paper we describe how deep neural networks (DNN) could be successfully employed for nation-state APT attribution. We use sandbox reports (recording the behavior of the APT when run dynamically) as raw input for the neural network, allowing the DNN to learn high level feature abstractions of the APTs itself. Using a test set of 1,000 Chinese and Russian developed APTs, we achieved an accuracy rate of 94.6%.

- `1712.01145v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01145v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01145v1)

> In this paper, we introduce and evaluate PROPEDEUTICA, a novel methodology and framework for efficient and effective real-time malware detection, leveraging the best of conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. In PROPEDEUTICA, all software processes in the system start execution subjected to a conventional ML detector for fast classification. If a piece of software receives a borderline classification, it is subjected to further analysis via more performance expensive and more accurate DL methods, via our newly proposed DL algorithm DEEPMALWARE. Further, we introduce delays to the execution of software subjected to deep learning analysis as a way to "buy time" for DL analysis and to rate-limit the impact of possible malware in the system. We evaluated PROPEDEUTICA with a set of 9,115 malware samples and 877 commonly used benign software samples from various categories for the Windows OS. Our results show that the false positive rate for conventional ML methods can reach 20%, and for modern DL methods it is usually below 6%. However, the classification time for DL can be 100X longer than conventional ML methods. PROPEDEUTICA improved the detection F1-score from 77.54% (conventional ML method) to 90.25%, and reduced the detection time by 54.86%. Further, the percentage of software subjected to DL analysis was approximately 40% on average. Further, the application of delays in software subjected to ML reduced the detection time by approximately 10%. Finally, we found and discussed a discrepancy between the detection accuracy offline (analysis after all traces are collected) and on-the-fly (analysis in tandem with trace collection). Our insights show that conventional ML and modern DL-based malware detectors in isolation cannot meet the needs of efficient and effective malware detection: high accuracy, low false positive rate, and short classification time.

> The scalable, low overhead attributes of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Internet protocols and networks lend themselves well to being exploited by criminals to execute a large range of cybercrimes. The types of crimes aided by P2P technology include copyright infringement, sharing of illicit images of children, fraud, hacking/cracking, denial of service attacks and virus/malware propagation through the use of a variety of worms, botnets, malware, viruses and P2P file sharing. This project is focused on study of active P2P nodes along with the analysis of the undocumented communication methods employed in many of these large unstructured networks. This is achieved through the design and implementation of an efficient P2P monitoring and crawling toolset. The requirement for investigating P2P based systems is not limited to the more obvious cybercrimes listed above, as many legitimate P2P based applications may also be pertinent to a digital forensic investigation, e.g, voice over IP, instant messaging, etc. Investigating these networks has become increasingly difficult due to the broad range of network topologies and the ever increasing and evolving range of P2P based applications. In this work we introduce the Universal P2P Network Investigation Framework (UP2PNIF), a framework which enables significantly faster and less labour intensive investigation of newly discovered P2P networks through the exploitation of the commonalities in P2P network functionality. In combination with a reference database of known network characteristics, it is envisioned that any known P2P network can be instantly investigated using the framework, which can intelligently determine the best investigation methodology and greatly expedite the evidence gathering process. A proof of concept tool was developed for conducting investigations on the BitTorrent network.

> Detecting PE malware files is now commonly approached using statistical and machine learning models. While these models commonly use features extracted from the structure of PE files, we propose that icons from these files can also help better predict malware. We propose an innovative machine learning approach to extract information from icons. Our proposed approach consists of two steps: 1) extracting icon features using summary statics, histogram of gradients (HOG), and a convolutional autoencoder, 2) clustering icons based on the extracted icon features. Using publicly available data and by using machine learning experiments, we show our proposed icon clusters significantly boost the efficacy of malware prediction models. In particular, our experiments show an average accuracy increase of 10% when icon clusters are used in the prediction model.

> Defending against botnets has always been a cat and mouse game. Cyber-security researchers and government agencies attempt to detect and take down botnets by playing the role of the cat. In this context, a lot of work has been done towards reverse engineering certain variants of malware families as well as understanding the network protocols of botnets to identify their weaknesses (if any) and exploit them. While this is necessary, such an approach offers the botmasters the ability to quickly counteract the defenders by simply performing small changes in their arsenals.   We attempt a different approach by actually taking the role of the Botmaster, to eventually anticipate his behavior. That said, in this paper, we present a novel computational trust mechanism for fully distributed botnets that allows for a resilient and stealthy management of the infected machines (zombies). We exploit the highly researched area of computational trust to create an autonomous mechanism that ensures the avoidance of common botnet tracking mechanisms such as sensors and crawlers. In our futuristic botnet, zombies are both smart and cautious. They are cautious in the sense that they are careful with whom they communicate with. Moreover, they are smart enough to learn from their experiences and infer whether their fellow zombies are indeed who they claim to be and not government agencies' spies. We study different computational trust models, mainly based on Bayesian inference, to evaluate their advantages and disadvantages in the context of a distributed botnet. Furthermore, we show, via our experimental results, that our approach is significantly stronger than any technique that has been seen in botnets to date.

> Android Malware has emerged as a consequence of the increasing popularity of smartphones and tablets. While most previous work focuses on inherent characteristics of Android apps to detect malware, this study analyses indirect features and meta-data to identify patterns in malware applications. Our experiments show that: (1) the permissions used by an application offer only moderate performance results; (2) other features publicly available at Android Markets are more relevant in detecting malware, such as the application developer and certificate issuer, and (3) compact and efficient classifiers can be constructed for the early detection of malware applications prior to code inspection or sandboxing.

> Encryption has increasingly been used in all applications for various purposes, but it also brings big challenges to network security. In this paper, we take first steps towards addressing some of these chal- lenges by introducing a novel system to identify key exchange protocols, which are usually required if encryption keys are not pre-shared. We ob- served that key exchange protocols yield certain patterns of high-entropy data blocks, e.g. as found in key material. We propose a multi-resolution approach of accurately detecting high-entropy data blocks and a method of generating scalable fingerprints for cryptographic protocols. We pro- vide experimental evidence that our approach has great potential for identifying cryptographic protocols by their unique key exchanges, and furthermore for detecting malware traffic that includes customized key exchange protocols.

> Recently researchers have proposed using deep learning-based systems for malware detection. Unfortunately, all deep learning classification systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous work has studied adversarial attacks against static analysis-based malware classifiers which only classify the content of the unknown file without execution. However, since the majority of malware is either packed or encrypted, malware classification based on static analysis often fails to detect these types of files. To overcome this limitation, anti-malware companies typically perform dynamic analysis by emulating each file in the anti-malware engine or performing in-depth scanning in a virtual machine. These strategies allow the analysis of the malware after unpacking or decryption. In this work, we study different strategies of crafting adversarial samples for dynamic analysis. These strategies operate on sparse, binary inputs in contrast to continuous inputs such as pixels in images. We then study the effects of two, previously proposed defensive mechanisms against crafted adversarial samples including the distillation and ensemble defenses. We also propose and evaluate the weight decay defense. Experiments show that with these three defensive strategies, the number of successfully crafted adversarial samples is reduced compared to a standard baseline system without any defenses. In particular, the ensemble defense is the most resilient to adversarial attacks. Importantly, none of the defenses significantly reduce the classification accuracy for detecting malware. Finally, we demonstrate that while adding additional hidden layers to neural models does not significantly improve the malware classification accuracy, it does significantly increase the classifier's robustness to adversarial attacks.

> Android OS experiences a blazing popularity since the last few years. This predominant platform has established itself not only in the mobile world but also in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This popularity, however, comes at the expense of security, as it has become a tempting target of malicious apps. Hence, there is an increasing need for sophisticated, automatic, and portable malware detection solutions. In this paper, we propose MalDozer, an automatic Android malware detection and family attribution framework that relies on sequences classification using deep learning techniques. Starting from the raw sequence of the app's API method calls, MalDozer automatically extracts and learns the malicious and the benign patterns from the actual samples to detect Android malware. MalDozer can serve as a ubiquitous malware detection system that is not only deployed on servers, but also on mobile and even IoT devices. We evaluate MalDozer on multiple Android malware datasets ranging from 1K to 33K malware apps, and 38K benign apps. The results show that MalDozer can correctly detect malware and attribute them to their actual families with an F1-Score of 96%-99% and a false positive rate of 0.06%-2%, under all tested datasets and settings.
