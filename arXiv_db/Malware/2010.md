> The number of malware variants is growing tremendously and the study of malware attacks on the Internet is still a demanding research domain. In this research, various logs from different OSI layer are explore to identify the traces leave on the attacker and victim logs, and the attack worm trace pattern are establish in order to reveal true attacker or victim. For the purpose of this paper, it will only concentrate on cybercrime that caused by malware network intrusion and used the traditional worm namely blaster worm variants. This research creates the concept of trace pattern by fusing the attackers and victims perspective. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose on attackers, victims and multistep, attacker or victim, trace patterns by combining both perspectives. These three proposed worm trace patterns can be extended into research areas in alert correlation and computer forensic investigation.

> There are plenty of security software in market; each claiming the best, still we daily face problem of viruses and other malicious activities. If we know the basic working principal of such malware then we can very easily prevent most of them even without security software. Hackers and crackers are experts in psychology to manipulate people into giving them access or the information necessary to get access. This paper discusses the inner working of such attacks. Case study of Spyware is provided. In this case study, we got 100% success using social engineering techniques for deception on Linux operating system, which is considered as the most secure operating system. Few basic principal of defend, for the individual as well as for the organization, are discussed here, which will prevent most of such attack if followed.

> The number of crime committed based on the malware intrusion is never ending as the number of malware variants is growing tremendously and the usage of internet is expanding globally. Malicious codes easily obtained and use as one of weapon to gain their objective illegally. Hence, in this research, diverse logs from different OSI layer are explored to identify the traces left on the attacker and victim logs in order to establish worm trace pattern to defending against the attack and help revealing true attacker or victim. For the purpose of this paper, it focused on malware intrusion and traditional worm namely sasser worm variants. The concept of trace pattern is created by fusing the attacker's and victim's perspective. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose a general worm trace pattern for attacker's, victim's and multi-step (attacker/victim)'s by combining both perspectives. These three proposed worm trace patterns can be extended into research areas in alert correlation and computer forensic investigation.

<summary>2010-08-25 20:04:58 - Malware Classification based on Call Graph Clustering</summary>

> Each day, anti-virus companies receive tens of thousands samples of potentially harmful executables. Many of the malicious samples are variations of previously encountered malware, created by their authors to evade pattern-based detection. Dealing with these large amounts of data requires robust, automatic detection approaches. This paper studies malware classification based on call graph clustering. By representing malware samples as call graphs, it is possible to abstract certain variations away, and enable the detection of structural similarities between samples. The ability to cluster similar samples together will make more generic detection techniques possible, thereby targeting the commonalities of the samples within a cluster. To compare call graphs mutually, we compute pairwise graph similarity scores via graph matchings which approximately minimize the graph edit distance. Next, to facilitate the discovery of similar malware samples, we employ several clustering algorithms, including k-medoids and DBSCAN. Clustering experiments are conducted on a collection of real malware samples, and the results are evaluated against manual classifications provided by human malware analysts. Experiments show that it is indeed possible to accurately detect malware families via call graph clustering. We anticipate that in the future, call graphs can be used to analyse the emergence of new malware families, and ultimately to automate implementation of generic detection schemes.

<summary>2010-09-21 05:49:33 - Malicious cryptography techniques for unreversable (malicious or not) binaries</summary>

> Fighting against computer malware require a mandatory step of reverse engineering. As soon as the code has been disassemblied/decompiled (including a dynamic analysis step), there is a hope to understand what the malware actually does and to implement a detection mean. This also applies to protection of software whenever one wishes to analyze them. In this paper, we show how to amour code in such a way that reserse engineering techniques (static and dymanic) are absolutely impossible by combining malicious cryptography techniques developped in our laboratory and new types of programming (k-ary codes). Suitable encryption algorithms combined with new cryptanalytic approaches to ease the protection of (malicious or not) binaries, enable to provide both total code armouring and large scale polymorphic features at the same time. A simple 400 Kb of executable code enables to produce a binary code and around $2^{140}$ mutated forms natively while going far beyond the old concept of decryptor.

<summary>2010-09-21 07:24:20 - Van Wijngaarden grammars, metamorphism and K-ary malwares</summary>

- *Geoffroy Gueguen*

> Grammars are used to describe sentences structure, thanks to some sets of rules, which depends on the grammar type. A classification of grammars has been made by Noam Chomsky, which led to four well-known types. Yet, there are other types of grammars, which do not exactly fit in Chomsky's classification, such as the two-level grammars. As their name suggests it, the main idea behind these grammars is that they are composed of two grammars. Van Wijngaarden grammars, particularly, are such grammars. They are interesting by their power (expressiveness), which can be the same, under some hypotheses, as the most powerful grammars of Chomsky's classification, i.e. Type 0 grammars. Another point of interest is their relative conciseness and readability. Van Wijngaarden grammars can describe static and dynamic semantic of a language. So, by using them as a generative engine, it is possible to generate a possibly infinite set of words, while assuring us that they all have the same semantic. Moreover, they can describe K-ary codes, by describing the semantic of each components of a code.

<summary>2010-11-03 02:37:52 - An Empirical Study of Spam and Spam Vulnerable email Accounts</summary>

- *Cynthia Dhinakaran, Dhinaharan Nagamalai, Jae Kwang Lee*

> Spam messages muddle up users inbox, consume network resources, and build up DDoS attacks, spread malware. Our goal is to present a definite figure about the characteristics of spam and spam vulnerable email accounts. These evaluations help us to enhance the existing technology to combat spam effectively. We collected 400 thousand spam mails from a spam trap set up in a corporate mail server for a period of 14 months form January 2006 to February 2007. Spammers use common techniques to spam end users regardless of corporate server and public mail server. So we believe that our spam collection is a sample of world wide spam traffic. Studying the characteristics of this sample helps us to better understand the features of spam and spam vulnerable e-mail accounts. We believe that this analysis is highly useful to develop more efficient anti spam techniques. In our analysis we classified spam based on attachment and contents. According to our study the four years old heavy users email accounts attract more spam than four years oldlight users mail accounts. The 14 months old relatively new email accounts don't receive spam. In some special cases like DDoS attacks, the new email accounts receive spam. During DDoS attack 14 months old heavy users email accounts have attracted more number of spam than 14 months old light users mail accounts.

> Malware usually target computers according to their operating system. Thus we have Windows malwares, Linux malwares and so on ... In this paper, we consider a different approach and show on a technical basis how easily malware can recognize and target systems selectively, according to the onboard processor chip. This technology is very easy to build since it does not rely on deep analysis of chip logical gates architecture. Floating Point Arithmetic (FPA) looks promising to define a set of tests to identify the processor or, more precisely, a subset of possible processors. We give results for different families of processors: AMD, Intel (Dual Core, Atom), Sparc, Digital Alpha, Cell, Atom ... As a conclusion, we propose two {\it open problems} that are new, to the authors' knowledge.
