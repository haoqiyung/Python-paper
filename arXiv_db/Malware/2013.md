> The application of machine learning to bioinformatics problems is well established. Less well understood is the application of bioinformatics techniques to machine learning and, in particular, the representation of non-biological data as biosequences. The aim of this paper is to explore the effects of giving amino acid representation to problematic machine learning data and to evaluate the benefits of supplementing traditional machine learning with bioinformatics tools and techniques. The signatures of 60 computer viruses and 60 computer worms were converted into amino acid representations and first multiply aligned separately to identify conserved regions across different families within each class (virus and worm). This was followed by a second alignment of all 120 aligned signatures together so that non-conserved regions were identified prior to input to a number of machine learning techniques. Differences in length between virus and worm signatures after the first alignment were resolved by the second alignment. Our first set of experiments indicates that representing computer malware signatures as amino acid sequences followed by alignment leads to greater classification and prediction accuracy. Our second set of experiments indicates that checking the results of data mining from artificial virus and worm data against known proteins can lead to generalizations being made from the domain of naturally occurring proteins to malware signatures. However, further work is needed to determine the advantages and disadvantages of different representations and sequence alignment methods for handling problematic machine learning data.

- *Haoyu Li, Di Ma, Nitesh Saxena, Babins Shrestha, Yan Zhu*

- `1302.4010v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4010v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4010v1)

> In this paper, we introduce a lightweight permission enforcement approach - Tap-Wave-Rub (TWR) - for smartphone malware prevention. TWR is based on simple human gestures that are very quick and intuitive but less likely to be exhibited in users' daily activities. Presence or absence of such gestures, prior to accessing an application, can effectively inform the OS whether the access request is benign or malicious. Specifically, we present the design of two mechanisms: (1) accelerometer based phone tapping detection; and (2) proximity sensor based finger tapping, rubbing or hand waving detection. The first mechanism is geared for NFC applications, which usually require the user to tap her phone with another device. The second mechanism involves very simple gestures, i.e., tapping or rubbing a finger near the top of phone's screen or waving a hand close to the phone, and broadly appeals to many applications (e.g., SMS). In addition, we present the TWR-enhanced Android permission model, the prototypes implementing the underlying gesture recognition mechanisms, and a variety of novel experiments to evaluate these mechanisms. Our results suggest the proposed approach could be very effective for malware detection and prevention, with quite low false positives and false negatives, while imposing little to no additional burden on the users.

> We outline here the mathematical expression of a diffusion model for cellphones malware transmitted through Bluetooth channels. In particular, we provide the deterministic formula underlying the proposed infection model, in its equivalent recursive (simple but computationally heavy) and closed form (more complex but efficiently computable) expression.

- `1303.3071v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3071v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3071v1)

> The numbers of the botnet attacks are increasing day by day and the detection of botnet spreading in the network has become very challenging. Bots are having specific characteristics in comparison of normal malware as they are controlled by the remote master server and usually dont show their behavior like normal malware until they dont receive any command from their master server. Most of time bot malware are inactive, hence it is very difficult to detect. Further the detection or tracking of the network of theses bots requires an infrastructure that should be able to collect the data from a diverse range of data sources and correlate the data to bring the bigger picture in view. In this paper, we are sharing our experience of botnet detection in the private network as well as in public zone by deploying the nepenthes honeypots. The automated framework for malware collection using nepenthes and analysis using anti-virus scan are discussed. The experimental results of botnet detection by enabling nepenthes honeypots in network are shown. Also we saw that existing known bots in our network can be detected.

- `1206.5829v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5829v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.5829v2)

> A common security architecture, called the permission-based security model (used e.g. in Android and Blackberry), entails intrinsic risks. For instance, applications can be granted more permissions than they actually need, what we call a "permission gap". Malware can leverage the unused permissions for achieving their malicious goals, for instance using code injection. In this paper, we present an approach to detecting permission gaps using static analysis. Our prototype implementation in the context of Android shows that the static analysis must take into account a significant amount of platform-specific knowledge. Using our tool on two datasets of Android applications, we found out that a non negligible part of applications suffers from permission gaps, i.e. does not use all the permissions they declare.

- `1303.7012v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.7012v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.7012v1)

> Malware family classification is an age old problem that many Anti-Virus (AV) companies have tackled. There are two common techniques used for classification, signature based and behavior based. Signature based classification uses a common sequence of bytes that appears in the binary code to identify and detect a family of malware. Behavior based classification uses artifacts created by malware during execution for identification. In this paper we report on a unique dataset we obtained from our operations and classified using several machine learning techniques using the behavior-based approach. Our main class of malware we are interested in classifying is the popular Zeus malware. For its classification we identify 65 features that are unique and robust for identifying malware families. We show that artifacts like file system, registry, and network features can be used to identify distinct malware families with high accuracy---in some cases as high as 95%.

<summary>2013-05-12 05:52:08 - Strategic Planning for Network Data Analysis</summary>

- *Kartik Talamadupula, Octavian Udrea, Anton Riabov, Anand Ranganathan*

- `1305.2561v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2561v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.2561v1)

> As network traffic monitoring software for cybersecurity, malware detection, and other critical tasks becomes increasingly automated, the rate of alerts and supporting data gathered, as well as the complexity of the underlying model, regularly exceed human processing capabilities. Many of these applications require complex models and constituent rules in order to come up with decisions that influence the operation of entire systems. In this paper, we motivate the novel "strategic planning" problem -- one of gathering data from the world and applying the underlying model of the domain in order to come up with decisions that will monitor the system in an automated manner. We describe our use of automated planning methods to this problem, including the technique that we used to solve it in a manner that would scale to the demands of a real-time, real world scenario. We then present a PDDL model of one such application scenario related to network administration and monitoring, followed by a description of a novel integrated system that was built to accept generated plans and to continue the execution process. Finally, we present evaluations of two different automated planners and their different capabilities with our integrated system, both on a six-month window of network data, and using a simulator.

- `1305.4210v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4210v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.4210v1)

> Mobile malware and mobile network attacks are becoming a significant threat that accompanies the increasing popularity of smart phones and tablets. Thus in this paper we present our research vision that aims to develop a network-based security solution combining analytical modelling, simulation and learning, together with billing and control-plane data, to detect anomalies and attacks, and eliminate or mitigate their effects, as part of the EU FP7 NEMESYS project. These ideas are supplemented with a careful review of the state-of-the-art regarding anomaly detection techniques that mobile network operators may use to protect their infrastructure and secure users against malware.

- `1305.5483v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5483v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.5483v1)

> As a consequence of the growing popularity of smart mobile devices, mobile malware is clearly on the rise, with attackers targeting valuable user information and exploiting vulnerabilities of the mobile ecosystems. With the emergence of large-scale mobile botnets, smartphones can also be used to launch attacks on mobile networks. The NEMESYS project will develop novel security technologies for seamless service provisioning in the smart mobile ecosystem, and improve mobile network security through better understanding of the threat landscape. NEMESYS will gather and analyze information about the nature of cyber-attacks targeting mobile users and the mobile network so that appropriate counter-measures can be taken. We will develop a data collection infrastructure that incorporates virtualized mobile honeypots and a honeyclient, to gather, detect and provide early warning of mobile attacks and better understand the modus operandi of cyber-criminals that target mobile devices. By correlating the extracted information with the known patterns of attacks from wireline networks, we will reveal and identify trends in the way that cyber-criminals launch attacks against mobile devices.

- `1307.5410v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5410v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.5410v1)

> Android is an open software platform for mobile devices with a large market share in the smartphone sector. The openness of the system as well as its wide adoption lead to an increasing amount of malware developed for this platform. ANANAS is an expandable and modular framework for analyzing Android applications. It takes care of common needs for dynamic malware analysis and provides an interface for the development of plugins. Adaptability and expandability have been main design goals during the development process. An abstraction layer for simple user interaction and phone event simulation is also part of the framework. It allows an analyst to script the required user simulation or phone events on demand or adjust the simulation to his needs. Six plugins have been developed for ANANAS. They represent well known techniques for malware analysis, such as system call hooking and network traffic analysis. The focus clearly lies on dynamic analysis, as five of the six plugins are dynamic analysis methods.

- `1307.5420v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5420v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.5420v1)

> As the anti-viruses run in a trusted kernel level any loophole in the anti-virus program can enable attackers to take full control over the computer system and steal data or do serious damages. Hence the anti-virus engines must be developed with proper security in mind. The ant-virus should be able to any type of specially created executable files, compression packages or documents that are intentionally created to exploit the anti-virus weakness.   Viruses are present in almost every system even though there are anti-viruses installed. This is because every anti-virus, however good it may be, leads to some extent of false positives and false negatives. Our faith on the anti-virus system often makes us more careless about hygienic habits which increases the possibility of infection. It is necessary for an anti-virus to detect and destroy the malware before its own files are detected and destroyed by the malware.

> During a fight between viruses and anti-viruses it is not always predictable that the anti-virus is going to win. There are many malicious viruses which target to attack and paralyze the anti-viruses. It is necessary for an anti-virus to detect and destroy the malware before its own files are detected and destroyed by the malware. The anti-virus may follow thorough testing and auditing procedures to fix all its bugs before releasing the software in the market. Besides the anti-virus may use all the obfuscation techniques like polymorphism that the viruses generally use to hide their codes. This article also shows how to use TRIZ Inventive Standards to solve the harmful effects of the viruses on the anti-virus.

- `1308.2831v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2831v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.2831v1)

> A serious threat today is malicious executables. It is designed to damage computer system and some of them spread over network without the knowledge of the owner using the system. Two approaches have been derived for it i.e. Signature Based Detection and Heuristic Based Detection. These approaches performed well against known malicious programs but cannot catch the new malicious programs. Different researchers have proposed methods using data mining and machine learning for detecting new malicious programs. The method based on data mining and machine learning has shown good results compared to other approaches. This work presents a static malware detection system using data mining techniques such as Information Gain, Principal component analysis, and three classifiers: SVM, J48, and Na\"ive Bayes. For overcoming the lack of usual anti-virus products, we use methods of static analysis to extract valuable features of Windows PE file. We extract raw features of Windows executables which are PE header information, DLLs, and API functions inside each DLL of Windows PE file. Thereafter, Information Gain, calling frequencies of the raw features are calculated to select valuable subset features, and then Principal Component Analysis is used for dimensionality reduction of the selected features. By adopting the concepts of machine learning and data-mining, we construct a static malware detection system which has a detection rate of 99.6%.

> Smartphones and mobile devices are rapidly becoming indispensable devices for many users. Unfortunately, they also become fertile grounds for hackers to deploy malware and to spread virus. There is an urgent need to have a "security analytic & forensic system" which can facilitate analysts to examine, dissect, associate and correlate large number of mobile applications. An effective analytic system needs to address the following questions: How to automatically collect and manage a high volume of mobile malware? How to analyze a zero-day suspicious application, and compare or associate it with existing malware families in the database? How to perform information retrieval so to reveal similar malicious logic with existing malware, and to quickly identify the new malicious code segment? In this paper, we present the design and implementation of DroidAnalytics, a signature based analytic system to automatically collect, manage, analyze and extract android malware. The system facilitates analysts to retrieve, associate and reveal malicious logics at the "opcode level". We demonstrate the efficacy of DroidAnalytics using 150,368 Android applications, and successfully determine 2,494 Android malware from 102 different families, with 342 of them being zero-day malware samples from six different families. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in showing such a large Android malware analysis/detection. The evaluation shows the DroidAnalytics is a valuable tool and is effective in analyzing malware repackaging and mutations.

- `1311.4201v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4201v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.4201v1)

> We present Anadroid, a static malware analysis framework for Android apps. Anadroid exploits two techniques to soundly raise precision: (1) it uses a pushdown system to precisely model dynamically dispatched interprocedural and exception-driven control-flow; (2) it uses Entry-Point Saturation (EPS) to soundly approximate all possible interleavings of asynchronous entry points in Android applications. (It also integrates static taint-flow analysis and least permissions analysis to expand the class of malicious behaviors which it can catch.) Anadroid provides rich user interface support for human analysts which must ultimately rule on the "maliciousness" of a behavior.   To demonstrate the effectiveness of Anadroid's malware analysis, we had teams of analysts analyze a challenge suite of 52 Android applications released as part of the Auto- mated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) DARPA program. The first team analyzed the apps using a ver- sion of Anadroid that uses traditional (finite-state-machine-based) control-flow-analysis found in existing malware analysis tools; the second team analyzed the apps using a version of Anadroid that uses our enhanced pushdown-based control-flow-analysis. We measured machine analysis time, human analyst time, and their accuracy in flagging malicious applications. With pushdown analysis, we found statistically significant (p < 0.05) decreases in time: from 85 minutes per app to 35 minutes per app in human plus machine analysis time; and statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in accuracy with the pushdown-driven analyzer: from 71% correct identification to 95% correct identification.

> One of the most significant threats faced by enterprise networks today is from Bots. A Bot is a program that operates as an agent for a user and runs automated tasks over the internet, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone. A collection of Bots in a network, used for malicious purposes is referred to as a Botnet. Bot attacks can range from localized attacks like key-logging to network intensive attacks like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). In this paper, we suggest a novel approach that can detect and combat Bots. The proposed solution adopts a two pronged strategy which we have classified into the standalone algorithm and the network algorithm. The standalone algorithm runs independently on each node of the network. It monitors the active processes on the node and tries to identify Bot processes using parameters such as response time and output to input traffic ratio. If a suspicious process has been identified the network algorithm is triggered. The network algorithm will then analyze conversations to and from the hosts of the network using the transport layer flow records. It then tries to deduce the Bot pattern as well as Bot signatures which can subsequently be used by the standalone algorithm to thwart Bot processes at their very onset.

- `1312.4814v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4814v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.4814v1)

> The number of malicious software (malware) is growing out of control. Syntactic signature based detection cannot cope with such growth and manual construction of malware signature databases needs to be replaced by computer learning based approaches. Currently, a single modern signature capturing the semantics of a malicious behavior can be used to replace an arbitrarily large number of old-fashioned syntactical signatures. However teaching computers to learn such behaviors is a challenge. Existing work relies on dynamic analysis to extract malicious behaviors, but such technique does not guarantee the coverage of all behaviors. To sidestep this limitation we show how to learn malware signatures using static reachability analysis. The idea is to model binary programs using pushdown systems (that can be used to model the stack operations occurring during the binary code execution), use reachability analysis to extract behaviors in the form of trees, and use subtrees that are common among the trees extracted from a training set of malware files as signatures. To detect malware we propose to use a tree automaton to compactly store malicious behavior trees and check if any of the subtrees extracted from the file under analysis is malicious. Experimental data shows that our approach can be used to learn signatures from a training set of malware files and use them to detect a test set of malware that is 5 times the size of the training set.
