> Malicious software is abundant in a world of innumerable computer users, who are constantly faced with these threats from various sources like the internet, local networks and portable drives. Malware is potentially low to high risk and can cause systems to function incorrectly, steal data and even crash. Malware may be executable or system library files in the form of viruses, worms, Trojans, all aimed at breaching the security of the system and compromising user privacy. Typically, anti-virus software is based on a signature definition system which keeps updating from the internet and thus keeping track of known viruses. While this may be sufficient for home-users, a security risk from a new virus could threaten an entire enterprise network. This paper proposes a new and more sophisticated antivirus engine that can not only scan files, but also build knowledge and detect files as potential viruses. This is done by extracting system API calls made by various normal and harmful executable, and using machine learning algorithms to classify and hence, rank files on a scale of security risk. While such a system is processor heavy, it is very effective when used centrally to protect an enterprise network which maybe more prone to such threats.

> Malware spread among websites and between websites and clients is an increasing problem. Search engines play an important role in directing users to websites and are a natural control point for intervening, using mechanisms such as blacklisting. The paper presents a simple Markov model of malware spread through large populations of websites and studies the effect of two interventions that might be deployed by a search provider: blacklisting infected web pages by removing them from search results entirely and a generalization of blacklisting, called depreferencing, in which a website's ranking is decreased by a fixed percentage each time period the site remains infected. We analyze and study the trade-offs between infection exposure and traffic loss due to false positives (the cost to a website that is incorrectly blacklisted) for different interventions. As expected, we find that interventions are most effective when websites are slow to remove infections. Surprisingly, we also find that low infection or recovery rates can increase traffic loss due to false positives. Our analysis also shows that heavy-tailed distributions of website popularity, as documented in many studies, leads to high sample variance of all measured outcomes. These result implies that it will be difficult to determine empirically whether certain website interventions are effective, and it suggests that theoretical models such as the one described in this paper have an important role to play in improving web security.

<summary>2012-02-17 20:28:50 - Modeling Internet-Scale Policies for Cleaning up Malware</summary>

- *Steven Hofmeyr, Tyler Moore, Stephanie Forrest, Benjamin Edwards, George Stelle*

- `1202.4008v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4008v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.4008v1)

> An emerging consensus among policy makers is that interventions undertaken by Internet Service Providers are the best way to counter the rising incidence of malware. However, assessing the suitability of countermeasures at this scale is hard. In this paper, we use an agent-based model, called ASIM, to investigate the impact of policy interventions at the Autonomous System level of the Internet. For instance, we find that coordinated intervention by the 0.2%-biggest ASes is more effective than uncoordinated efforts adopted by 30% of all ASes. Furthermore, countermeasures that block malicious transit traffic appear more effective than ones that block outgoing traffic. The model allows us to quantify and compare positive externalities created by different countermeasures. Our results give an initial indication of the types and levels of intervention that are most cost-effective at large scale.

<summary>2012-02-26 04:36:54 - S3A: Secure System Simplex Architecture for Enhanced Security of Cyber-Physical Systems</summary>

- *Sibin Mohan, Stanley Bak, Emiliano Betti, Heechul Yun, Lui Sha, Marco Caccamo*

- `1202.5722v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5722v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.5722v1)

> Until recently, cyber-physical systems, especially those with safety-critical properties that manage critical infrastructure (e.g. power generation plants, water treatment facilities, etc.) were considered to be invulnerable against software security breaches. The recently discovered 'W32.Stuxnet' worm has drastically changed this perception by demonstrating that such systems are susceptible to external attacks. Here we present an architecture that enhances the security of safety-critical cyber-physical systems despite the presence of such malware. Our architecture uses the property that control systems have deterministic execution behavior, to detect an intrusion within 0.6 {\mu}s while still guaranteeing the safety of the plant. We also show that even if an attack is successful, the overall state of the physical system will still remain safe. Even if the operating system's administrative privileges have been compromised, our architecture will still be able to protect the physical system from coming to harm.

- `1204.1601v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1601v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.1601v1)

> Nowadays, mobile handsets combine the functionality of mobile phones and PDAs. Unfortunately, mobile handsets development process has been driven by market demand, focusing on new features and neglecting security. So, it is imperative to study the existing challenges that facing the mobile handsets threat containment process, and the different techniques and methodologies that used to face those challenges and contain the mobile handsets malwares. This paper also presents a new approach to group the different malware containment systems according to their typologies.

- *Michal Kryczka, Ruben Cuevas, Roberto Gonzalez, Angel Cuevas, Arturo Azcorra*

- `1105.3671v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3671v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.3671v3)

> In this paper we conduct a large scale measurement study in order to analyse the fake content publishing phenomenon in the BitTorrent Ecosystem. Our results reveal that fake content represents an important portion (35%) of those files shared in BitTorrent and just a few tens of users are responsible for 90% of this content. Furthermore, more than 99% of the analysed fake files are linked to either malware or scam websites. This creates a serious threat for the BitTorrent ecosystem. To address this issue, we present a new detection tool named TorrentGuard for the early detection of fake content. Based on our evaluation this tool may prevent the download of more than 35 millions of fake files per year. This could help to reduce the number of computer infections and scams suffered by BitTorrent users. TorrentGuard is already available and it can be accessed through both a webpage or a Vuze plugin.

<summary>2012-07-24 22:42:56 - SODEXO: A System Framework for Deployment and Exploitation of Deceptive Honeybots in Social Networks</summary>

- *Quanyan Zhu, Andrew Clark, Radha Poovendran, Tamer Basar*

- `1207.5844v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5844v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.5844v1)

> As social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are becoming increasingly popular, a growing number of malicious attacks, such as phishing and malware, are exploiting them. Among these attacks, social botnets have sophisticated infrastructure that leverages compromised users accounts, known as bots, to automate the creation of new social networking accounts for spamming and malware propagation. Traditional defense mechanisms are often passive and reactive to non-zero-day attacks. In this paper, we adopt a proactive approach for enhancing security in social networks by infiltrating botnets with honeybots. We propose an integrated system named SODEXO which can be interfaced with social networking sites for creating deceptive honeybots and leveraging them for gaining information from botnets. We establish a Stackelberg game framework to capture strategic interactions between honeybots and botnets, and use quantitative methods to understand the tradeoffs of honeybots for their deployment and exploitation in social networks. We design a protection and alert system that integrates both microscopic and macroscopic models of honeybots and optimally determines the security strategies for honeybots. We corroborate the proposed mechanism with extensive simulations and comparisons with passive defenses.

<summary>2012-08-11 15:07:54 - TCP Injections for Fun and Clogging</summary>

- *Yossi Gilad, Amir Herzberg*

- `1208.2357v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2357v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.2357v1)

> We present a new type of clogging DoS attacks, with the highest amplification factors achieved by off-path attackers, using only puppets, i.e., sandboxed malware on victim machines. Specifically, we present off-path variants of the Opt-ack, Ack-storm and Coremelt DoS attacks, achieving results comparable to these achieved previously achieved by eavesdropping/MitM attackers and (unrestricted) malware. In contrast to previous off-path attacks, which attacked the client (machine) running the malware, our attacks address a very different goal: large-scale clogging DoS of a third party, or even of backbone connections.   Our clogging attacks are based on off-path TCP injections. Indeed, as an additional contribution, we present improved off-path TCP injection attacks. Our new attacks significantly relax the requirements cf. to the known attacks; specifically, our injection attack requires only a Java script in browser sandbox (not 'restricted malware'), does not depend on specific operating system properties, and is efficient even when client's port is determined using recommended algorithm. Our attacks are constructed modularly, allowing reuse of modules for other scenarios and replacing modules as necessary. We present specific defenses, however, this work is further proof to the need to base security on sound foundations, using cryptography to provide security even against MitM attackers.

<summary>2012-08-14 14:25:32 - Torinj : Automated Exploitation Malware Targeting Tor Users</summary>

- *Gerard Wagener, Alexandre Dulaunoy, Radu State*

- `1208.2877v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2877v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.2877v1)

> We propose in this paper a new propagation vector for malicious software by abusing the Tor network. Tor is particularly relevant, since operating a Tor exit node is easy and involves low costs compared to attack institutional or ISP networks. After presenting the Tor network from an attacker perspective, we describe an automated exploitation malware which is operated on a Tor exit node targeting to infect web browsers. Our experiments show that the current deployed Tor network, provides a large amount of potential victims.

<summary>2012-09-12 09:16:13 - Chip and Skim: cloning EMV cards with the pre-play attack</summary>

- *Mike Bond, Omar Choudary, Steven J. Murdoch, Sergei Skorobogatov, Ross Anderson*

- `1209.2531v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2531v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.2531v1)

> EMV, also known as "Chip and PIN", is the leading system for card payments worldwide. It is used throughout Europe and much of Asia, and is starting to be introduced in North America too. Payment cards contain a chip so they can execute an authentication protocol. This protocol requires point-of-sale (POS) terminals or ATMs to generate a nonce, called the unpredictable number, for each transaction to ensure it is fresh. We have discovered that some EMV implementers have merely used counters, timestamps or home-grown algorithms to supply this number. This exposes them to a "pre-play" attack which is indistinguishable from card cloning from the standpoint of the logs available to the card-issuing bank, and can be carried out even if it is impossible to clone a card physically (in the sense of extracting the key material and loading it into another card). Card cloning is the very type of fraud that EMV was supposed to prevent. We describe how we detected the vulnerability, a survey methodology we developed to chart the scope of the weakness, evidence from ATM and terminal experiments in the field, and our implementation of proof-of-concept attacks. We found flaws in widely-used ATMs from the largest manufacturers. We can now explain at least some of the increasing number of frauds in which victims are refused refunds by banks which claim that EMV cards cannot be cloned and that a customer involved in a dispute must therefore be mistaken or complicit. Pre-play attacks may also be carried out by malware in an ATM or POS terminal, or by a man-in-the-middle between the terminal and the acquirer. We explore the design and implementation mistakes that enabled the flaw to evade detection until now: shortcomings of the EMV specification, of the EMV kernel certification process, of implementation testing, formal analysis, or monitoring customer complaints. Finally we discuss countermeasures.

<summary>2012-09-26 15:56:07 - PlaceRaider: Virtual Theft in Physical Spaces with Smartphones</summary>

- *Robert Templeman, Zahid Rahman, David Crandall, Apu Kapadia*

- `1209.5982v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5982v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.5982v1)

> As smartphones become more pervasive, they are increasingly targeted by malware. At the same time, each new generation of smartphone features increasingly powerful onboard sensor suites. A new strain of sensor malware has been developing that leverages these sensors to steal information from the physical environment (e.g., researchers have recently demonstrated how malware can listen for spoken credit card numbers through the microphone, or feel keystroke vibrations using the accelerometer). Yet the possibilities of what malware can see through a camera have been understudied. This paper introduces a novel visual malware called PlaceRaider, which allows remote attackers to engage in remote reconnaissance and what we call virtual theft. Through completely opportunistic use of the camera on the phone and other sensors, PlaceRaider constructs rich, three dimensional models of indoor environments. Remote burglars can thus download the physical space, study the environment carefully, and steal virtual objects from the environment (such as financial documents, information on computer monitors, and personally identifiable information). Through two human subject studies we demonstrate the effectiveness of using mobile devices as powerful surveillance and virtual theft platforms, and we suggest several possible defenses against visual malware.

<summary>2012-10-11 05:58:41 - A Survey on Web Spam Detection Methods: Taxonomy</summary>

- *Shekoofeh Ghiam, Alireza Nemaney Pour*

- `1210.3131v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3131v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.3131v1)

> Web spam refers to some techniques, which try to manipulate search engine ranking algorithms in order to raise web page position in search engine results. In the best case, spammers encourage viewers to visit their sites, and provide undeserved advertisement gains to the page owner. In the worst case, they use malicious contents in their pages and try to install malware on the victims machine. Spammers use three kinds of spamming techniques to get higher score in ranking. These techniques are Link based techniques, hiding techniques and content-based techniques. Existing spam pages cause distrust to search engine results. This not only wastes the time of visitors, but also wastes lots of search engine resources. Hence spam detection methods have been proposed as a solution for web spam in order to reduce negative effects of spam pages. Experimental results show that some of these techniques are working well and can find spam pages more accurate than the others. This paper classifies web spam techniques and the related detection methods.

- `1211.6610v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.6610v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.6610v1)

> Smartphone technology is more and more becoming the predominant communication tool for people across the world. People use their smartphones to keep their contact data, to browse the internet, to exchange messages, to keep notes, carry their personal files and documents, etc. Users while browsing are also capable of shopping online, thus provoking a need to type their credit card numbers and security codes. As the smartphones are becoming widespread so do the security threats and vulnerabilities facing this technology. Recent news and articles indicate huge increase in malware and viruses for operating systems employed on smartphones (primarily Android and iOS). Major limitations of smartphone technology are its processing power and its scarce energy source since smartphones rely on battery usage. Since smartphones are devices which change their network location as the user moves between different places, intrusion detection systems for smartphone technology are most often classified as IDSs designed for mobile ad-hoc networks. The aim of this research is to give a brief overview of IDS technology, give an overview of major machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms used in IDS technologies, give an overview of security models of iOS and Android and propose a new host-based IDS model for smartphones and create proof-of-concept application for Android platform for the newly proposed model.
