> The propagation techniques and the payload of Duqu have been closely studied over the past year and it has been said that Duqu shared functionalities with Stuxnet. We focused on the driver used by Duqu during the infection, our contribution consists in reverse-engineering the driver: we rebuilt its source code and analyzed the mechanisms it uses to execute the payload while avoiding detection. Then we diverted the driver into a defensive version capable of detecting injections in Windows binaries, thus preventing further attacks. We specifically show how Duqu's modified driver would have detected Duqu.

> The economics of an internet crime has newly developed into a field of controlling black money. This economic approach not only provides estimated technique of analyzing internet crimes but also gives details to analyzers of system dependability and divergence. This paper will highlight on the subject of online crime, which has formed its industry since. It all started from amateur hackers who cracked websites and wrote malicious software in pursuit of fun or achieving limited objectives to professional hacking. In the past days, electronic fraud was main objective but now it has been changed into electronic hacking. This study focuses the issue through an economic analysis of available web forum to deals in malware and private information. The findings of this survey research provide considerable in-depth sight into the functions of malware economy spinning around computer impositions and compromise. In this regard, the survey research paper may benefit particularly computer security officials, the law enforcement agencies, and in general prospective anyone involved in better understanding cybercrime from the offender standpoint.

- `1401.6726v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6726v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.6726v1)

> The problem of malware has become significant on Android devices. Library operating systems and application virtualization are both possible solutions for confining malware. Unfortunately, such solutions do not exist for Android. Designing mechanisms for application virtualization is a significant chal- lenge for several reasons: (1) graphics performance is important due to popularity of games and (2) applications with the same UID can share state. This paper presents Anception, the first flexible application virtualization framework for Android. It is imple- mented as a modification to the Android kernel and supports application virtualization that addresses the above requirements. Anception is able to confine many types of malware while supporting unmodified Android applications. Our Anception- based system exhibits up to 3.9% overhead on various 2D/3D benchmarks, and 1.8% overhead on the SunSpider benchmark.

<summary>2014-01-29 09:20:53 - Securing Smartphones: A Micro-TCB Approach</summary>

- *Yossi Gilad, Amir Herzberg, Ari Trachtenberg*

- `1401.7444v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7444v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.7444v1)

> As mobile phones have evolved into `smartphones', with complex operating systems running third- party software, they have become increasingly vulnerable to malicious applications (malware). We introduce a new design for mitigating malware attacks against smartphone users, based on a small trusted computing base module, denoted uTCB. The uTCB manages sensitive data and sensors, and provides core services to applications, independently of the operating system. The user invokes uTCB using a simple secure attention key, which is pressed in order to validate physical possession of the device and authorize a sensitive action; this protects private information even if the device is infected with malware. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of uTCB based on ARM's TrustZone, a secure execution environment increasingly found in smartphones, and evaluate our implementation using simulations.

- `1401.7727v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7727v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.7727v1)

> Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are among the most popular classification techniques adopted in security applications like malware detection, intrusion detection, and spam filtering. However, if SVMs are to be incorporated in real-world security systems, they must be able to cope with attack patterns that can either mislead the learning algorithm (poisoning), evade detection (evasion), or gain information about their internal parameters (privacy breaches). The main contributions of this chapter are twofold. First, we introduce a formal general framework for the empirical evaluation of the security of machine-learning systems. Second, according to our framework, we demonstrate the feasibility of evasion, poisoning and privacy attacks against SVMs in real-world security problems. For each attack technique, we evaluate its impact and discuss whether (and how) it can be countered through an adversary-aware design of SVMs. Our experiments are easily reproducible thanks to open-source code that we have made available, together with all the employed datasets, on a public repository.

<summary>2014-02-09 18:19:59 - A Novel Approach to Detect Spam Worms Propagation with Monitoring the Footprinting</summary>

- *Rajesh R Chauhan, G S Praveen Kumar*

- `1402.1974v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1974v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.1974v1)

> One of the key security threats on the Internet are the compromised machines that can be used to launch various security attacks such as spamming and spreading malware, accessing useful information and DDoS. Attackers for spamming activity are volunteer by large number of compromised machines. Our main focus is on detection of the compromised machines in a network that may be or are involved in the spamming activities; these machines are commonly known as spam zombies. Activities such as port scan, DB scan and so on are treated as malicious activity within the network. So to overcome that we develop one of the most effective spam zombie detection system within the network based on the behavior of other systems as if performing the above activities are treated as zombies machines. If any system within the network try's to gather some information about any other system then this is treated as a malicious activity and should be not allowed to do so. SYN packets are used in order to initiate communication within the network so as to establish connection. If any system try's to flood the network with these packets we can make an assumption that the system is trying to gather the information about other system. This is what called footprinting. So we will try to detect any system involved in footprinting and report to the administrator.

<summary>2014-02-19 21:08:11 - PuppetDroid: A User-Centric UI Exerciser for Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Similar Android Applications</summary>

- *Andrea Gianazza, Federico Maggi, Aristide Fattori, Lorenzo Cavallaro, Stefano Zanero*

- `1402.4826v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4826v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.4826v1)

> Popularity and complexity of malicious mobile applications are rising, making their analysis difficult and labor intensive. Mobile application analysis is indeed inherently different from desktop application analysis: In the latter, the interaction of the user (i.e., victim) is crucial for the malware to correctly expose all its malicious behaviors.   We propose a novel approach to analyze (malicious) mobile applications. The goal is to exercise the user interface (UI) of an Android application to effectively trigger malicious behaviors, automatically. Our key intuition is to record and reproduce the UI interactions of a potential victim of the malware, so as to stimulate the relevant behaviors during dynamic analysis. To make our approach scale, we automatically re-execute the recorded UI interactions on apps that are similar to the original ones. These characteristics make our system orthogonal and complementary to current dynamic analysis and UI-exercising approaches.   We developed our approach and experimentally shown that our stimulation allows to reach a higher code coverage than automatic UI exercisers, so to unveil interesting malicious behaviors that are not exposed when using other approaches.   Our approach is also suitable for crowdsourcing scenarios, which would push further the collection of new stimulation traces. This can potentially change the way we conduct dynamic analysis of (mobile) applications, from fully automatic only, to user-centric and collaborative too.

<summary>2014-02-26 11:28:12 - Authentication Mechanism for Resistance to Password Stealing and Reuse Attack</summary>

- *Sharayu A. Aghav, RajneeshKaur Bedi*

- `1402.6497v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6497v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.6497v1)

> Considering computer systems, security is the major concern with usability. Security policies need to be developed to protect information from unauthorized access. Passwords and secrete codes used between users and information systems for secure user authentication with the system. Playing a vital role in security, easily guessed passwords are links to vulnerability. They allow invader to put system resources significantly closer to access them, other accounts on nearby machines and possibly even administrative privileges with different threats and vulnerabilities (e.g., phishing, key logging and malwares). The purpose of this system is to introduce the concept and methodology which helps organization and users to implement stronger password policies. This paper studies a password stealing and reuse issues of password based authentication systems. Techniques and concepts of authentication are discussed which gives rise to a novel approach of two-factor authentication. Avoiding password reuse is a crucial issue in information systems which can at some extent contribute to password stealing issue also. In the proposed system, each participating website possesses a user's unique phone number, telecommunication services in registration and recovery phases and a long-term password used to generate one-time password for each login session on all websites.

<summary>2014-02-27 16:58:12 - The Company You Keep: Mobile Malware Infection Rates and Inexpensive Risk Indicators</summary>

- *Hien Thi Thu Truong, Eemil Lagerspetz, Petteri Nurmi, Adam J. Oliner, Sasu Tarkoma, N. Asokan, Sourav Bhattacharya*

- `1312.3245v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3245v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.3245v2)

> There is little information from independent sources in the public domain about mobile malware infection rates. The only previous independent estimate (0.0009%) [12], was based on indirect measurements obtained from domain name resolution traces. In this paper, we present the first independent study of malware infection rates and associated risk factors using data collected directly from over 55,000 Android devices. We find that the malware infection rates in Android devices estimated using two malware datasets (0.28% and 0.26%), though small, are significantly higher than the previous independent estimate. Using our datasets, we investigate how indicators extracted inexpensively from the devices correlate with malware infection. Based on the hypothesis that some application stores have a greater density of malicious applications and that advertising within applications and cross-promotional deals may act as infection vectors, we investigate whether the set of applications used on a device can serve as an indicator for infection of that device. Our analysis indicates that this alone is not an accurate indicator for pinpointing infection. However, it is a very inexpensive but surprisingly useful way for significantly narrowing down the pool of devices on which expensive monitoring and analysis mechanisms must be deployed. Using our two malware datasets we show that this indicator performs 4.8 and 4.6 times (respectively) better at identifying infected devices than the baseline of random checks. Such indicators can be used, for example, in the search for new or previously undetected malware. It is therefore a technique that can complement standard malware scanning by anti-malware tools. Our analysis also demonstrates a marginally significant difference in battery use between infected and clean devices.

<summary>2014-03-07 02:53:15 - Optimal Patching in Clustered Malware Epidemics</summary>

- `1403.1639v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1639v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.1639v1)

> Studies on the propagation of malware in mobile networks have revealed that the spread of malware can be highly inhomogeneous. Platform diversity, contact list utilization by the malware, clustering in the network structure, etc. can also lead to differing spreading rates. In this paper, a general formal framework is proposed for leveraging such heterogeneity to derive optimal patching policies that attain the minimum aggregate cost due to the spread of malware and the surcharge of patching. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle for a stratified epidemic model, it is analytically proven that in the mean-field deterministic regime, optimal patch disseminations are simple single-threshold policies. Through numerical simulations, the behavior of optimal patching policies is investigated in sample topologies and their advantages are demonstrated.

<summary>2014-03-28 14:49:44 - Unsupervised Anomaly-based Malware Detection using Hardware Features</summary>

- *Adrian Tang, Simha Sethumadhavan, Salvatore Stolfo*

- `1403.1631v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1631v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.1631v2)

> Recent works have shown promise in using microarchitectural execution patterns to detect malware programs. These detectors belong to a class of detectors known as signature-based detectors as they catch malware by comparing a program's execution pattern (signature) to execution patterns of known malware programs. In this work, we propose a new class of detectors - anomaly-based hardware malware detectors - that do not require signatures for malware detection, and thus can catch a wider range of malware including potentially novel ones. We use unsupervised machine learning to build profiles of normal program execution based on data from performance counters, and use these profiles to detect significant deviations in program behavior that occur as a result of malware exploitation. We show that real-world exploitation of popular programs such as IE and Adobe PDF Reader on a Windows/x86 platform can be detected with nearly perfect certainty. We also examine the limits and challenges in implementing this approach in face of a sophisticated adversary attempting to evade anomaly-based detection. The proposed detector is complementary to previously proposed signature-based detectors and can be used together to improve security.

- `1404.6699v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6699v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.6699v1)

> Attributing a cyber-operation through the use of multiple pieces of technical evidence (i.e., malware reverse-engineering and source tracking) and conventional intelligence sources (i.e., human or signals intelligence) is a difficult problem not only due to the effort required to obtain evidence, but the ease with which an adversary can plant false evidence. In this paper, we introduce a formal reasoning system called the InCA (Intelligent Cyber Attribution) framework that is designed to aid an analyst in the attribution of a cyber-operation even when the available information is conflicting and/or uncertain. Our approach combines argumentation-based reasoning, logic programming, and probabilistic models to not only attribute an operation but also explain to the analyst why the system reaches its conclusions.

- `1405.6058v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6058v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.6058v1)

> Protecting commodity operating systems and applications against malware and targeted attacks has proven to be difficult. In recent years, virtualization has received attention from security researchers who utilize it to harden existing systems and provide strong security guarantees. This has lead to interesting use cases such as cloud computing where possibly sensitive data is processed on remote, third party systems. The migration and processing of data in remote servers, poses new technical and legal questions, such as which security measures should be taken to protect this data or how can it be proven that execution of code wasn't tampered with. In this paper we focus on technological aspects. We discuss the various possibilities of security within the virtualization layer and we use as a case study \HelloRootkitty{}, a lightweight invariance-enforcing framework which allows an operating system to recover from kernel-level attacks. In addition to \HelloRootkitty{}, we also explore the use of special hardware chips as a way of further protecting and guaranteeing the integrity of a virtualized system.

- `1308.2903v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2903v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.2903v2)

> We present ConXsense, the first framework for context-aware access control on mobile devices based on context classification. Previous context-aware access control systems often require users to laboriously specify detailed policies or they rely on pre-defined policies not adequately reflecting the true preferences of users. We present the design and implementation of a context-aware framework that uses a probabilistic approach to overcome these deficiencies. The framework utilizes context sensing and machine learning to automatically classify contexts according to their security and privacy-related properties. We apply the framework to two important smartphone-related use cases: protection against device misuse using a dynamic device lock and protection against sensory malware. We ground our analysis on a sociological survey examining the perceptions and concerns of users related to contextual smartphone security and analyze the effectiveness of our approach with real-world context data. We also demonstrate the integration of our framework with the FlaskDroid architecture for fine-grained access control enforcement on the Android platform.

- `1406.5569v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5569v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5569v1)

> Citadel is an advanced information-stealing malware which targets financial information. This malware poses a real threat against the confidentiality and integrity of personal and business data. A joint operation was recently conducted by the FBI and the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit in order to take down Citadel command-and-control servers. The operation caused some disruption in the botnet but has not stopped it completely. Due to the complex structure and advanced anti-reverse engineering techniques, the Citadel malware analysis process is both challenging and time-consuming. This allows cyber criminals to carry on with their attacks while the analysis is still in progress. In this paper, we present the results of the Citadel reverse engineering and provide additional insight into the functionality, inner workings, and open source components of the malware. In order to accelerate the reverse engineering process, we propose a clone-based analysis methodology. Citadel is an offspring of a previously analyzed malware called Zeus; thus, using the former as a reference, we can measure and quantify the similarities and differences of the new variant. Two types of code analysis techniques are provided in the methodology, namely assembly to source code matching and binary clone detection. The methodology can help reduce the number of functions requiring manual analysis. The analysis results prove that the approach is promising in Citadel malware analysis. Furthermore, the same approach is applicable to similar malware analysis scenarios.

> Network steganography is the art of hiding secret information within innocent network transmissions. Recent findings indicate that novel malware is increasingly using network steganography. Similarly, other malicious activities can profit from network steganography, such as data leakage or the exchange of pedophile data. This paper provides an introduction to network steganography and highlights its potential application for harmful purposes. We discuss the issues related to countering network steganography in practice and provide an outlook on further research directions and problems.

> We address the problem of creating entire and complete maps of software code clones (copy features in data) in a corpus of binary artifacts of unknown provenance. We report on a practical methodology, which employs enhanced suffix data structures and partial orderings of clones to compute a compact representation of most interesting clones features in data. The enumeration of clone features is useful for malware triage and prioritization when human exploration, testing and verification is the most costly factor. We further show that the enhanced arrays may be used for discovery of provenance relations in data and we introduce two distinct Jaccard similarity coefficients to measure code similarity in binary artifacts. We illustrate the use of these tools on real malware data including a retro-diction experiment for measuring and enumerating evidence supporting common provenance in {\it Stuxnet} and {\it Duqu}. The results indicate the practicality and efficacy of mapping completely the clone features in data.

- `1408.3934v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3934v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.3934v1)

> The use of short text messages in social media and instant messaging has become a popular communication channel during the last years. This rising popularity has caused an increment in messaging threats such as spam, phishing or malware as well as other threats. The processing of these short text message threats could pose additional challenges such as the presence of lexical variants, SMS-like contractions or advanced obfuscations which can degrade the performance of traditional filtering solutions. By using a real-world SMS data set from a large telecommunications operator from the US and a social media corpus, in this paper we analyze the effectiveness of machine learning filters based on linguistic and behavioral patterns in order to detect short text spam and abusive users in the network. We have also explored different ways to deal with short text message challenges such as tokenization and entity detection by using text normalization and substring clustering techniques. The obtained results show the validity of the proposed solution by enhancing baseline approaches.

> In this paper, we address the knowledge engineering problems for hypothesis generation motivated by applications that require timely exploration of hypotheses under unreliable observations. We looked at two applications: malware detection and intensive care delivery. In intensive care, the goal is to generate plausible hypotheses about the condition of the patient from clinical observations and further refine these hypotheses to create a recovery plan for the patient. Similarly, preventing malware spread within a corporate network involves generating hypotheses from network traffic data and selecting preventive actions. To this end, building on the already established characterization and use of AI planning for similar problems, we propose use of planning for the hypothesis generation problem. However, to deal with uncertainty, incomplete model description and unreliable observations, we need to use a planner capable of generating multiple high-quality plans. To capture the model description we propose a language called LTS++ and a web-based tool that enables the specification of the LTS++ model and a set of observations. We also proposed a 9-step process that helps provide guidance to the domain expert in specifying the LTS++ model. The hypotheses are then generated by running a planner on the translated LTS++ model and the provided trace. The hypotheses can be visualized and shown to the analyst or can be further investigated automatically.

In particular, both changes in the overall environment by external disturbances, as well as, feedback effects from malware competition and antivirus coevolution have driven community succession and the development of different types of malware with varying modes of transmission and adaptability.

> Similarity metrics, e.g., signatures as used by anti-virus products, are the dominant technique to detect if a given binary is malware. The underlying assumption of this approach is that all instances of a malware (or even malware family) will be similar to each other.   Software diversification is a probabilistic technique that uses code and data randomization and expressiveness in the target instruction set to generate large amounts of functionally equivalent but different binaries. Malware diversity builds on software diversity and ensures that any two diversified instances of the same malware have low similarity (according to a set of similarity metrics). An LLVM-based prototype implementation diversifies both code and data of binaries and our evaluation shows that signatures based on similarity only match one or few instances in a pool of diversified binaries generated from the same source code.

> Peer-to-Peer (P2P) botnets are becoming widely used as a low-overhead, efficient, self-maintaining, distributed alternative to the traditional client/server model across a broad range of cyberattacks. These cyberattacks can take the form of distributed denial of service attacks, authentication cracking, spamming, cyberwarfare or malware distribution targeting on financial systems. These attacks can also cross over into the physical world attacking critical infrastructure causing its disruption or destruction (power, communications, water, etc.). P2P technology lends itself well to being exploited for such malicious purposes due to the minimal setup, running and maintenance costs involved in executing a globally orchestrated attack, alongside the perceived additional layer of anonymity. In the ever-evolving space of botnet technology, reducing the time lag between discovering a newly developed or updated botnet system and gaining the ability to mitigate against it is paramount. Often, numerous investigative bodies duplicate their efforts in creating bespoke tools to combat particular threats. This paper outlines a framework capable of fast tracking the investigative process through collaboration between key stakeholders.

> Malware writers have employed various obfuscation and polymorphism techniques to thwart static analysis approaches and bypassing antivirus tools. Dynamic analysis techniques, however, have essentially overcome these deceits by observing the actual behaviour of the code execution. In this regard, various methods, techniques and tools have been proposed. However, because of the diverse concepts and strategies used in the implementation of these methods and tools, security researchers and malware analysts find it difficult to select the required optimum tool to investigate the behaviour of a malware and to contain the associated risk for their study. Focusing on two dynamic analysis techniques: Function Call monitoring and Information Flow Tracking, this paper presents a comparison framework for dynamic malware analysis tools. The framework will assist the researchers and analysts to recognize the tools implementation strategy, analysis approach, system wide analysis support and its overall handling of binaries, helping them to select a suitable and effective one for their study and analysis.

> This paper identifies an intrusion surveillance framework which provides an analyst with the ability to investigate and monitor cyber-attacks in a covert manner. Where cyber-attacks are perpetrated for the purposes of espionage the ability to understand an adversary's techniques and objectives are an important element in network and computer security. With the appropriate toolset, security investigators would be permitted to perform both live and stealthy counter-intelligence operations by observing the behaviour and communications of the intruder. Subsequently a more complete picture of the attacker's identity, objectives, capabilities, and infiltration could be formulated than is possible with present technologies. This research focused on developing an extensible framework to permit the covert investigation of malware. Additionally, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) Mass Storage Device (MSD) based covert channel was designed to enable remote command and control of the framework. The work was validated through the design, implementation and testing of a toolset.

> Expecting the shipment of 1 billion Android devices in 2017, cyber criminals have naturally extended their vicious activities towards Google's mobile operating system. With an estimated number of 700 new Android applications released every day, keeping control over malware is an increasingly challenging task. In recent years, a vast number of static and dynamic code analysis platforms for analyzing Android applications and making decision regarding their maliciousness have been introduced in academia and in the commercial world. These platforms differ heavily in terms of feature support and application properties being analyzed. In this paper, we give an overview of the state-of-the-art dynamic code analysis platforms for Android and evaluate their effectiveness with samples from known malware corpora as well as known Android bugs like Master Key. Our results indicate a low level of diversity in analysis platforms resulting from code reuse that leaves the evaluated systems vulnerable to evasion. Furthermore the Master Key bugs could be exploited by malware to hide malicious behavior from the sandboxes.

> Analyzing Android applications for malicious behavior is an important area of research, and is made difficult, in part, by the increasingly large number of applications available for the platform. While techniques exist to perform static analysis on a large number of applications, dynamic analysis techniques are relatively limited in scale due to the computational resources required to emulate the full Android system to achieve accurate execution. We present Andlantis, a scalable dynamic analysis system capable of processing over 3000 Android applications per hour. During this processing, the system is able to collect valuable forensic data, which helps reverse-engineers and malware researchers identify and understand anomalous application behavior. We discuss the results of running 1261 malware samples through the system, and provide examples of malware analysis performed with the resulting data.

> Botnets represent a global problem and are responsible for causing large financial and operational damage to their victims. They are implemented with evasion in mind, and aim at hiding their architecture and authors, making them difficult to detect in general. These kinds of networks are mainly used for identity theft, virtual extortion, spam campaigns and malware dissemination. Botnets have a great potential in warfare and terrorist activities, making it of utmost importance to take action against. We present CONDENSER, a method for identifying data generated by botnet activity. We start by selecting appropriate the features from several data feeds, namely DNS non-existent domain responses and live communication packages directed to command and control servers that we previously sinkholed. By using machine learning algorithms and a graph based representation of data, then allows one to identify botnet activity, helps identifying anomalous traffic, quickly detect new botnets and improve activities of tracking known botnets. Our main contributions are threefold: first, the use of a machine learning classifier for classifying domain names as being generated by domain generation algorithms (DGA); second, a clustering algorithm using the set of selected features that groups network communication with similar patterns; third, a graph based knowledge representation framework where we store processed data, allowing us to perform queries.

> Information is the most critical asset of modern organizations, and accordingly coveted by adversaries. When highly sensitive data is involved, an organization may resort to air-gap isolation, in which there is no networking connection between the inner network and the external world. While infiltrating an air-gapped network has been proven feasible in recent years (e.g., Stuxnet), data exfiltration from an air-gapped network is still considered to be one of the most challenging phases of an advanced cyber-attack. In this paper we present "AirHopper", a bifurcated malware that bridges the air-gap between an isolated network and nearby infected mobile phones using FM signals. While it is known that software can intentionally create radio emissions from a video display unit, this is the first time that mobile phones are considered in an attack model as the intended receivers of maliciously crafted radio signals. We examine the attack model and its limitations, and discuss implementation considerations such as stealth and modulation methods. Finally, we evaluate AirHopper and demonstrate how textual and binary data can be exfiltrated from physically isolated computer to mobile phones at a distance of 1-7 meters, with effective bandwidth of 13-60 Bps (Bytes per second).

> Mobile networks are vulnerable to signalling attacks and storms that are caused by traffic patterns that overload the control plane, and differ from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in the Internet since they directly attack the control plane, and also reserve wireless bandwidth without actually using it. Such attacks can result from malware and mobile botnets, as well as from poorly designed applications, and can cause service outages in 3G and 4G networks which have been experienced by mobile operators. Since the radio resource control (RRC) protocol in 3G and 4G networks is particularly susceptible to such attacks, we analyze their effect with a mathematical model that helps to predict the congestion that is caused by an attack. A detailed simulation model of a mobile network is used to better understand the temporal dynamics of user behavior and signalling in the network and to show how RRC based signalling attacks and storms cause significant problems in the control plane and the user plane of the network. Our analysis also serves to identify how storms can be detected, and to propose how system parameters can be chosen to mitigate their effect.

> Recent years have seen the rise of more sophisticated attacks including advanced persistent threats (APTs) which pose severe risks to organizations and governments by targeting confidential proprietary information. Additionally, new malware strains are appearing at a higher rate than ever before. Since many of these malware are designed to evade existing security products, traditional defenses deployed by most enterprises today, e.g., anti-virus, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, often fail at detecting infections at an early stage.   We address the problem of detecting early-stage infection in an enterprise setting by proposing a new framework based on belief propagation inspired from graph theory. Belief propagation can be used either with "seeds" of compromised hosts or malicious domains (provided by the enterprise security operation center -- SOC) or without any seeds. In the latter case we develop a detector of C&C communication particularly tailored to enterprises which can detect a stealthy compromise of only a single host communicating with the C&C server.   We demonstrate that our techniques perform well on detecting enterprise infections. We achieve high accuracy with low false detection and false negative rates on two months of anonymized DNS logs released by Los Alamos National Lab (LANL), which include APT infection attacks simulated by LANL domain experts. We also apply our algorithms to 38TB of real-world web proxy logs collected at the border of a large enterprise. Through careful manual investigation in collaboration with the enterprise SOC, we show that our techniques identified hundreds of malicious domains overlooked by state-of-the-art security products.

<summary>2014-12-30 18:06:23 - Detecting Malicious Code by Exploiting Dependencies of System-call Groups</summary>

- *Stavros D. Nikolopoulos, Iosif Polenakis*

- `1412.8712v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8712v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.8712v1)

> In this paper we present an elaborated graph-based algorithmic technique for efficient malware detection. More precisely, we utilize the system-call dependency graphs (or, for short ScD graphs), obtained by capturing taint analysis traces and a set of various similarity metrics in order to detect whether an unknown test sample is a malicious or a benign one. For the sake of generalization, we decide to empower our model against strong mutations by applying our detection technique on a weighted directed graph resulting from ScD graph after grouping disjoint subsets of its vertices. Additionally, we have developed a similarity metric, which we call NP-similarity, that combines qualitative, quantitative, and relational characteristics that are spread among the members of known malware families to archives a clear distinction between graph-representations of malware and the ones of benign software. Finally, we evaluate our detection model and compare our results against the results achieved by a variety of techniques proving the potentials of our model.
