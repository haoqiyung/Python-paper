> Decompilation aims to transform a low-level program language (LPL) (eg., binary file) into its functionally-equivalent high-level program language (HPL) (e.g., C/C++). It is a core technology in software security, especially in vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the successful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural language processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers by borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate the decompilation process as a translation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost required to develop decompilation tools and improve their generalizability. However, state-of-the-art learning-based decompilers do not cope well with compiler-optimized binaries. Since real-world binaries are mostly compiler-optimized, decompilers that do not consider optimized binaries have limited practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries. NeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an intermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and optimized binary. We also design an Optimized Translation Unit (OTU) to split functions into smaller code fragments for better translation performance. Evaluation results on datasets containing various types of statements show that NeurDP can decompile optimized binaries with 45.21% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art neural decompilation frameworks.

<summary>2023-01-03 11:06:20 - Analysis of Label-Flip Poisoning Attack on Machine Learning Based Malware Detector</summary>

- *Kshitiz Aryal, Maanak Gupta, Mahmoud Abdelsalam*

- `2301.01044v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01044v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01044v1)

> With the increase in machine learning (ML) applications in different domains, incentives for deceiving these models have reached more than ever. As data is the core backbone of ML algorithms, attackers shifted their interest toward polluting the training data. Data credibility is at even higher risk with the rise of state-of-art research topics like open design principles, federated learning, and crowd-sourcing. Since the machine learning model depends on different stakeholders for obtaining data, there are no reliable automated mechanisms to verify the veracity of data from each source.   Malware detection is arduous due to its malicious nature with the addition of metamorphic and polymorphic ability in the evolving samples. ML has proven to solve the zero-day malware detection problem, which is unresolved by traditional signature-based approaches. The poisoning of malware training data can allow the malware files to go undetected by the ML-based malware detectors, helping the attackers to fulfill their malicious goals. A feasibility analysis of the data poisoning threat in the malware detection domain is still lacking. Our work will focus on two major sections: training ML-based malware detectors and poisoning the training data using the label-poisoning approach. We will analyze the robustness of different machine learning models against data poisoning with varying volumes of poisoning data.

<summary>2023-01-09 17:26:37 - Efficient Attack Detection in IoT Devices using Feature Engineering-Less Machine Learning</summary>

- *Arshiya Khan, Chase Cotton*

- `2301.03532v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03532v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.03532v1)

> Through the generalization of deep learning, the research community has addressed critical challenges in the network security domain, like malware identification and anomaly detection. However, they have yet to discuss deploying them on Internet of Things (IoT) devices for day-to-day operations. IoT devices are often limited in memory and processing power, rendering the compute-intensive deep learning environment unusable. This research proposes a way to overcome this barrier by bypassing feature engineering in the deep learning pipeline and using raw packet data as input. We introduce a feature engineering-less machine learning (ML) process to perform malware detection on IoT devices. Our proposed model, "Feature engineering-less-ML (FEL-ML)," is a lighter-weight detection algorithm that expends no extra computations on "engineered" features. It effectively accelerates the low-powered IoT edge. It is trained on unprocessed byte-streams of packets. Aside from providing better results, it is quicker than traditional feature-based methods. FEL-ML facilitates resource-sensitive network traffic security with the added benefit of eliminating the significant investment by subject matter experts in feature engineering.

<summary>2023-01-12 14:25:31 - Open SESAME: Fighting Botnets with Seed Reconstructions of Domain Generation Algorithms</summary>

- *Nils Weissgerber, Thorsten Jenke, Elmar Padilla, Lilli Bruckschen*

- `2301.05048v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05048v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05048v1)

> An important aspect of many botnets is their capability to generate pseudorandom domain names using Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). A cyber criminal can register such domains to establish periodically changing rendezvous points with the bots. DGAs make use of seeds to generate sets of domains. Seeds can easily be changed in order to generate entirely new groups of domains while using the same underlying algorithm. While this requires very little manual effort for an adversary, security specialists typically have to manually reverse engineer new malware strains to reconstruct the seeds. Only when the seed and DGA are known, past and future domains can be generated, efficiently attributed, blocked, sinkholed or used for a take-down. Common counters in the literature consist of databases or Machine Learning (ML) based detectors to keep track of past and future domains of known DGAs and to identify DGA-generated domain names, respectively. However, database based approaches can not detect domains generated by new DGAs, and ML approaches can not generate future domain names. In this paper, we introduce SESAME, a system that combines the two above-mentioned approaches and contains a module for automatic Seed Reconstruction, which is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind. It is used to automatically classify domain names, rate their novelty, and determine the seeds of the underlying DGAs. SESAME consists of multiple DGA-specific Seed Reconstructors and is designed to work purely based on domain names, as they are easily obtainable from observing the network traffic. We evaluated our approach on 20.8 gigabytes of DNS-lookups. Thereby, we identified 17 DGAs, of which 4 were entirely new to us.
