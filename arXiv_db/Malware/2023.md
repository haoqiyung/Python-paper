<summary>2023-01-03 06:45:54 - Boosting Neural Networks to Decompile Optimized Binaries</summary>

- *Ying Cao, Ruigang Liang, Kai Chen, Peiwei Hu*

- `2301.00969v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00969v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00969v1)

> Decompilation aims to transform a low-level program language (LPL) (eg., binary file) into its functionally-equivalent high-level program language (HPL) (e.g., C/C++). It is a core technology in software security, especially in vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the successful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural language processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers by borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate the decompilation process as a translation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost required to develop decompilation tools and improve their generalizability. However, state-of-the-art learning-based decompilers do not cope well with compiler-optimized binaries. Since real-world binaries are mostly compiler-optimized, decompilers that do not consider optimized binaries have limited practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries. NeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an intermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and optimized binary. We also design an Optimized Translation Unit (OTU) to split functions into smaller code fragments for better translation performance. Evaluation results on datasets containing various types of statements show that NeurDP can decompile optimized binaries with 45.21% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art neural decompilation frameworks.

- *Kshitiz Aryal, Maanak Gupta, Mahmoud Abdelsalam*

- `2301.01044v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01044v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01044v1)

> With the increase in machine learning (ML) applications in different domains, incentives for deceiving these models have reached more than ever. As data is the core backbone of ML algorithms, attackers shifted their interest toward polluting the training data. Data credibility is at even higher risk with the rise of state-of-art research topics like open design principles, federated learning, and crowd-sourcing. Since the machine learning model depends on different stakeholders for obtaining data, there are no reliable automated mechanisms to verify the veracity of data from each source.   Malware detection is arduous due to its malicious nature with the addition of metamorphic and polymorphic ability in the evolving samples. ML has proven to solve the zero-day malware detection problem, which is unresolved by traditional signature-based approaches. The poisoning of malware training data can allow the malware files to go undetected by the ML-based malware detectors, helping the attackers to fulfill their malicious goals. A feasibility analysis of the data poisoning threat in the malware detection domain is still lacking. Our work will focus on two major sections: training ML-based malware detectors and poisoning the training data using the label-poisoning approach. We will analyze the robustness of different machine learning models against data poisoning with varying volumes of poisoning data.

<summary>2023-01-09 17:26:37 - Efficient Attack Detection in IoT Devices using Feature Engineering-Less Machine Learning</summary>

- *Arshiya Khan, Chase Cotton*

- `2301.03532v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03532v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.03532v1)

> Through the generalization of deep learning, the research community has addressed critical challenges in the network security domain, like malware identification and anomaly detection. However, they have yet to discuss deploying them on Internet of Things (IoT) devices for day-to-day operations. IoT devices are often limited in memory and processing power, rendering the compute-intensive deep learning environment unusable. This research proposes a way to overcome this barrier by bypassing feature engineering in the deep learning pipeline and using raw packet data as input. We introduce a feature engineering-less machine learning (ML) process to perform malware detection on IoT devices. Our proposed model, "Feature engineering-less-ML (FEL-ML)," is a lighter-weight detection algorithm that expends no extra computations on "engineered" features. It effectively accelerates the low-powered IoT edge. It is trained on unprocessed byte-streams of packets. Aside from providing better results, it is quicker than traditional feature-based methods. FEL-ML facilitates resource-sensitive network traffic security with the added benefit of eliminating the significant investment by subject matter experts in feature engineering.

<summary>2023-01-12 14:25:31 - Open SESAME: Fighting Botnets with Seed Reconstructions of Domain Generation Algorithms</summary>

- *Nils Weissgerber, Thorsten Jenke, Elmar Padilla, Lilli Bruckschen*

- `2301.05048v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05048v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05048v1)

> An important aspect of many botnets is their capability to generate pseudorandom domain names using Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). A cyber criminal can register such domains to establish periodically changing rendezvous points with the bots. DGAs make use of seeds to generate sets of domains. Seeds can easily be changed in order to generate entirely new groups of domains while using the same underlying algorithm. While this requires very little manual effort for an adversary, security specialists typically have to manually reverse engineer new malware strains to reconstruct the seeds. Only when the seed and DGA are known, past and future domains can be generated, efficiently attributed, blocked, sinkholed or used for a take-down. Common counters in the literature consist of databases or Machine Learning (ML) based detectors to keep track of past and future domains of known DGAs and to identify DGA-generated domain names, respectively. However, database based approaches can not detect domains generated by new DGAs, and ML approaches can not generate future domain names. In this paper, we introduce SESAME, a system that combines the two above-mentioned approaches and contains a module for automatic Seed Reconstruction, which is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind. It is used to automatically classify domain names, rate their novelty, and determine the seeds of the underlying DGAs. SESAME consists of multiple DGA-specific Seed Reconstructors and is designed to work purely based on domain names, as they are easily obtainable from observing the network traffic. We evaluated our approach on 20.8 gigabytes of DNS-lookups. Thereby, we identified 17 DGAs, of which 4 were entirely new to us.

<summary>2023-01-15 07:34:31 - A Review on the effectiveness of Dimensional Reduction with Computational Forensics: An Application on Malware Analysis</summary>

- *Aye Thaw Da Naing, Justin Soh Beng Guan, Yarzar Shwe Win, Jonathan Pan*

- `2301.06031v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06031v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.06031v1)

> The Android operating system is pervasively adopted as the operating system platform of choice for smart devices. However, the strong adoption has also resulted in exponential growth in the number of Android based malicious software or malware. To deal with such cyber threats as part of cyber investigation and digital forensics, computational techniques in the form of machine learning algorithms are applied for such malware identification, detection and forensics analysis. However, such Computational Forensics modelling techniques are constrained the volume, velocity, variety and veracity of the malware landscape. This in turn would affect its identification and detection effectiveness. Such consequence would inherently induce the question of sustainability with such solution approach. One approach to optimise effectiveness is to apply dimensional reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis with the intent to enhance algorithmic performance. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of the application of Principle Component Analysis on Computational Forensics task of detecting Android based malware. We applied our research hypothesis to three different datasets with different machine learning algorithms. Our research result showed that the dimensionally reduced dataset would result in a measure of degradation in accuracy performance.

<summary>2023-01-15 07:52:31 - A New Deep Boosted CNN and Ensemble Learning based IoT Malware Detection</summary>

- *Saddam Hussain Khan, Wasi Ullah*

- `2212.08008v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08008v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08008v3)

> Security issues are threatened in various types of networks, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment that requires early detection. IoT is the network of real-time devices like home automation systems and can be controlled by open-source android devices, which can be an open ground for attackers. Attackers can access the network credentials, initiate a different kind of security breach, and compromises network control. Therefore, timely detecting the increasing number of sophisticated malware attacks is the challenge to ensure the credibility of network protection. In this regard, we have developed a new malware detection framework, Deep Squeezed-Boosted and Ensemble Learning (DSBEL), comprised of novel Squeezed-Boosted Boundary-Region Split-Transform-Merge (SB-BR-STM) CNN and ensemble learning. The proposed STM block employs multi-path dilated convolutional, Boundary, and regional operations to capture the homogenous and heterogeneous global malicious patterns. Moreover, diverse feature maps are achieved using transfer learning and multi-path-based squeezing and boosting at initial and final levels to learn minute pattern variations. Finally, the boosted discriminative features are extracted from the developed deep SB-BR-STM CNN and provided to the ensemble classifiers (SVM, MLP, and AdabooSTM1) to improve the hybrid learning generalization. The performance analysis of the proposed DSBEL framework and SB-BR-STM CNN against the existing techniques have been evaluated by the IOT_Malware dataset on standard performance measures. Evaluation results show progressive performance as 98.50% accuracy, 97.12% F1-Score, 91.91% MCC, 95.97 % Recall, and 98.42 % Precision. The proposed malware analysis framework is robust and helpful for the timely detection of malicious activity and suggests future strategies

<summary>2023-01-18 07:31:41 - One Size Does not Fit All: Quantifying the Risk of Malicious App Encounters for Different Android User Profiles</summary>

- *Savino Dambra, Leyla Bilge, Platon Kotzias, Yun Shen, Juan Caballero*

- `2301.07346v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07346v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07346v1)

> Previous work has investigated the particularities of security practices within specific user communities defined based on country of origin, age, prior tech abuse, and economic status. Their results highlight that current security solutions that adopt a one-size-fits-all-users approach ignore the differences and needs of particular user communities. However, those works focus on a single community or cluster users into hard-to-interpret sub-populations.   In this work, we perform a large-scale quantitative analysis of the risk of encountering malware and other potentially unwanted applications (PUA) across user communities. At the core of our study is a dataset of app installation logs collected from 12M Android mobile devices. Leveraging user-installed apps, we define intuitive profiles based on users' interests (e.g., gamers and investors), and fit a subset of 5.4M devices to those profiles. Our analysis is structured in three parts. First, we perform risk analysis on the whole population to measure how the risk of malicious app encounters is affected by different factors. Next, we create different profiles to investigate whether risk differences across users may be due to their interests. Finally, we compare a per-profile approach for classifying clean and infected devices with the classical approach that considers the whole population.   We observe that features such as the diversity of the app signers and the use of alternative markets highly correlate with the risk of malicious app encounters. We also discover that some profiles such as gamers and social-media users are exposed to more than twice the risks experienced by the average users. We also show that the classification outcome has a marked accuracy improvement when using a per-profile approach to train the prediction models. Overall, our results confirm the inadequacy of one-size-fits-all protection solutions.

- *Nidhi Rastogi, Sharmishtha Dutta, Mohammed J. Zaki, Alex Gittens, Charu Aggarwal*

- `2102.05571v6` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05571v6) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05571v6)

> Threat intelligence on malware attacks and campaigns is increasingly being shared with other security experts for a cost or for free. Other security analysts use this intelligence to inform them of indicators of compromise, attack techniques, and preventative actions. Security analysts prepare threat analysis reports after investigating an attack, an emerging cyber threat, or a recently discovered vulnerability. Collectively known as cyber threat intelligence (CTI), the reports are typically in an unstructured format and, therefore, challenging to integrate seamlessly into existing intrusion detection systems. This paper proposes a framework that uses the aggregated CTI for analysis and defense at scale. The information is extracted and stored in a structured format using knowledge graphs such that the semantics of the threat intelligence can be preserved and shared at scale with other security analysts. Specifically, we propose the first semi-supervised open-source knowledge graph-based framework, TINKER, to capture cyber threat information and its context. Following TINKER, we generate a Cyberthreat Intelligence Knowledge Graph (CTI-KG) and demonstrate the usage using different use cases.

<summary>2023-01-20 16:07:26 - StratDef: Strategic Defense Against Adversarial Attacks in ML-based Malware Detection</summary>

- *Aqib Rashid, Jose Such*

- `2202.07568v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07568v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07568v4)

> Over the years, most research towards defenses against adversarial attacks on machine learning models has been in the image recognition domain. The malware detection domain has received less attention despite its importance. Moreover, most work exploring these defenses has focused on several methods but with no strategy when applying them. In this paper, we introduce StratDef, which is a strategic defense system based on a moving target defense approach. We overcome challenges related to the systematic construction, selection, and strategic use of models to maximize adversarial robustness. StratDef dynamically and strategically chooses the best models to increase the uncertainty for the attacker while minimizing critical aspects in the adversarial ML domain, like attack transferability. We provide the first comprehensive evaluation of defenses against adversarial attacks on machine learning for malware detection, where our threat model explores different levels of threat, attacker knowledge, capabilities, and attack intensities. We show that StratDef performs better than other defenses even when facing the peak adversarial threat. We also show that, of the existing defenses, only a few adversarially-trained models provide substantially better protection than just using vanilla models but are still outperformed by StratDef.

- *Henrik Brodin, Evan Sultanik, Marek Surovič*

- `2301.08700v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08700v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08700v1)

> A blind spot is any input to a program that can be arbitrarily mutated without affecting the program's output. Blind spots can be used for steganography or to embed malware payloads. If blind spots overlap file format keywords, they indicate parsing bugs that can lead to differentials. This paper formalizes the operational semantics of blind spots, leading to a technique that automatically detects blind spots based on dynamic information flow tracking. An efficient implementation is introduced an evaluated against a corpus of over a thousand diverse PDFs. There are zero false-positive blind spot classifications and the missed detection rate is bounded above by 11%. On average, at least 5% of each PDF file is completely ignored by the parser. Our results show promise that this technique is an efficient automated means to detect parser bugs and differentials. Nothing in the technique is tied to PDF in general, so it can be immediately applied to other notoriously difficult-to-parse formats like ELF, X.509, and XML.

- `2301.11050v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11050v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11050v1)

> Ransomware is a rapidly evolving type of malware designed to encrypt user files on a device, making them inaccessible in order to exact a ransom. Ransomware attacks resulted in billions of dollars in damages in recent years and are expected to cause hundreds of billions more in the next decade. With current state-of-the-art process-based detectors being heavily susceptible to evasion attacks, no comprehensive solution to this problem is available today. This paper presents Minerva, a new approach to ransomware detection. Unlike current methods focused on identifying ransomware based on process-level behavioral modeling, Minerva detects ransomware by building behavioral profiles of files based on all the operations they receive in a time window. Minerva addresses some of the critical challenges associated with process-based approaches, specifically their vulnerability to complex evasion attacks. Our evaluation of Minerva demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting ransomware attacks, including those that are able to bypass existing defenses. Our results show that Minerva identifies ransomware activity with an average accuracy of 99.45% and an average recall of 99.66%, with 99.97% of ransomware detected within 1 second.

> Cyber-crimes have become a multi-billion-dollar industry in the recent years. Most cybercrimes/attacks involve deploying some type of malware. Malware that viciously targets every industry, every sector, every enterprise and even individuals has shown its capabilities to take entire business organizations offline and cause significant financial damage in billions of dollars annually. Malware authors are constantly evolving in their attack strategies and sophistication and are developing malware that is difficult to detect and can lay dormant in the background for quite some time in order to evade security controls. Given the above argument, Traditional approaches to malware detection are no longer effective. As a result, deep learning models have become an emerging trend to detect and classify malware. This paper proposes a new convolutional deep learning neural network to accurately and effectively detect malware with high precision. This paper is different than most other papers in the literature in that it uses an expert data science approach by developing a convolutional neural network from scratch to establish a baseline of the performance model first, explores and implements an improvement model from the baseline model, and finally it evaluates the performance of the final model. The baseline model initially achieves 98% accurate rate but after increasing the depth of the CNN model, its accuracy reaches 99.183 which outperforms most of the CNN models in the literature. Finally, to further solidify the effectiveness of this CNN model, we use the improved model to make predictions on new malware samples within our dataset.

> Neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks, where the attackers maliciously poison the training set and insert triggers into the test input to change the prediction of the victim model. Existing defenses for backdoor attacks either provide no formal guarantees or come with expensive-to-compute and ineffective probabilistic guarantees. We present PECAN, an efficient and certified approach for defending against backdoor attacks. The key insight powering PECAN is to apply off-the-shelf test-time evasion certification techniques on a set of neural networks trained on disjoint partitions of the data. We evaluate PECAN on image classification and malware detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that PECAN can (1) significantly outperform the state-of-the-art certified backdoor defense, both in defense strength and efficiency, and (2) on real back-door attacks, PECAN can reduce attack success rate by order of magnitude when compared to a range of baselines from the literature.

> Open source intelligence is a powerful tool for cybersecurity analysts to gather information both for analysis of discovered vulnerabilities and for detecting novel cybersecurity threats and exploits. However the scale of information that is relevant for information security on the internet is always increasing, and is intractable for analysts to parse comprehensively. Therefore methods of condensing the available open source intelligence, and automatically developing connections between disparate sources of information, is incredibly valuable. In this research, we present a system which constructs a Neo4j graph database formed by shared connections between open source intelligence text including blogs, cybersecurity bulletins, news sites, antivirus scans, social media posts (e.g., Reddit and Twitter), and threat reports. These connections are comprised of possible indicators of compromise (e.g., IP addresses, domains, hashes, email addresses, phone numbers), information on known exploits and techniques (e.g., CVEs and MITRE ATT&CK Technique ID's), and potential sources of information on cybersecurity exploits such as twitter usernames. The construction of the database of potential IoCs is detailed, including the addition of machine learning and metadata which can be used for filtering of the data for a specific domain (for example a specific natural language) when needed. Examples of utilizing the graph database for querying connections between known malicious IoCs and open source intelligence documents, including threat reports, are shown. We show that this type of relationship querying can allow for more effective use of open source intelligence for threat hunting, malware family clustering, and vulnerability analysis.

> Due to its simple installation and connectivity, the Internet of Things (IoT) is susceptible to malware attacks. Being able to operate autonomously. As IoT devices have become more prevalent, they have become the most tempting targets for malware. Weak, guessable, or hard-coded passwords, and a lack of security measures contribute to these vulnerabilities along with insecure network connections and outdated update procedures. To understand IoT malware, current methods and analysis ,using static methods, are ineffective. The field of deep learning has made great strides in recent years due to their tremendous data mining, learning, and expression capabilities, cybersecurity has enjoyed tremendous growth in recent years. As a result, malware analysts will not have to spend as much time analyzing malware. In this paper, we propose a novel detection and analysis method that harnesses the power and simplicity of decision trees. The experiments are conducted using a real word dataset, MaleVis which is a publicly available dataset. Based on the results, we show that our proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in that it achieves 97.23% precision and 95.89% recall in terms of detection and classification. A specificity of 96.58%, F1-score of 96.40%, an accuracy of 96.43.

> We present a new algorithm to train a robust malware detector. Modern malware detectors rely on machine learning algorithms. Now, the adversarial objective is to devise alterations to the malware code to decrease the chance of being detected whilst preserving the functionality and realism of the malware. Adversarial learning is effective in improving robustness but generating functional and realistic adversarial malware samples is non-trivial. Because: i) in contrast to tasks capable of using gradient-based feedback, adversarial learning in a domain without a differentiable mapping function from the problem space (malware code inputs) to the feature space is hard; and ii) it is difficult to ensure the adversarial malware is realistic and functional. This presents a challenge for developing scalable adversarial machine learning algorithms for large datasets at a production or commercial scale to realize robust malware detectors. We propose an alternative; perform adversarial learning in the feature space in contrast to the problem space. We prove the projection of perturbed, yet valid malware, in the problem space into feature space will always be a subset of adversarials generated in the feature space. Hence, by generating a robust network against feature-space adversarial examples, we inherently achieve robustness against problem-space adversarial examples. We formulate a Bayesian adversarial learning objective that captures the distribution of models for improved robustness. We prove that our learning method bounds the difference between the adversarial risk and empirical risk explaining the improved robustness. We show that adversarially trained BNNs achieve state-of-the-art robustness. Notably, adversarially trained BNNs are robust against stronger attacks with larger attack budgets by a margin of up to 15% on a recent production-scale malware dataset of more than 20 million samples.

> The popularity and relative openness of Android means it is a popular target for malware. Over the years, various studies have found that machine learning models can effectively discriminate malware from benign applications. However, as the operating system evolves, so does malware, bringing into question the findings of these previous studies, many of which used small, outdated, and often imbalanced datasets. In this paper, we reimplement 16 representative past works and evaluate them on a balanced, relevant and up-to-date dataset comprising 124,000 Android applications. We also carry out new experiments designed to fill holes in existing knowledge, and use our findings to identify the most effective features and models to use for Android malware detection within a contemporary environment. Our results suggest that accuracies of up to 96.8% can be achieved using static features alone, with a further 1% achievable using more expensive dynamic analysis approaches. We find the best models to be random forests built from API call usage and TCP network traffic features.

> The extensive damage caused by malware requires anti-malware systems to be constantly improved to prevent new threats. The current trend in malware detection is to employ machine learning models to aid in the classification process. We propose a new dataset with the objective of improving current anti-malware systems. The focus of this dataset is to improve host based intrusion detection systems by providing API call sequences for thousands of malware samples executed in Windows 10 virtual machines. A tutorial on how to create and expand this dataset is provided along with a benchmark demonstrating how to use this dataset to classify malware. The data contains long sequences of API calls for each sample, and in order to create models that can be deployed in resource constrained devices, three feature selection methods were tested. The principal innovation, however, lies in the multi-label classification system in which one sequence of APIs can be tagged with multiple labels describing its malicious behaviours.

> Certified defenses are a recent development in adversarial machine learning (ML), which aim to rigorously guarantee the robustness of ML models to adversarial perturbations. A large body of work studies certified defenses in computer vision, where $\ell_p$ norm-bounded evasion attacks are adopted as a tractable threat model. However, this threat model has known limitations in vision, and is not applicable to other domains -- e.g., where inputs may be discrete or subject to complex constraints. Motivated by this gap, we study certified defenses for malware detection, a domain where attacks against ML-based systems are a real and current threat. We consider static malware detection systems that operate on byte-level data. Our certified defense is based on the approach of randomized smoothing which we adapt by: (1) replacing the standard Gaussian randomization scheme with a novel deletion randomization scheme that operates on bytes or chunks of an executable; and (2) deriving a certificate that measures robustness to evasion attacks in terms of generalized edit distance. To assess the size of robustness certificates that are achievable while maintaining high accuracy, we conduct experiments on malware datasets using a popular convolutional malware detection model, MalConv. We are able to accurately classify 91% of the inputs while being certifiably robust to any adversarial perturbations of edit distance 128 bytes or less. By comparison, an existing certification of up to 128 bytes of substitutions (without insertions or deletions) achieves an accuracy of 78%. In addition, given that robustness certificates are conservative, we evaluate practical robustness to several recently published evasion attacks and, in some cases, find robustness beyond certified guarantees.

> Several moving target defenses (MTDs) to counter adversarial ML attacks have been proposed in recent years. MTDs claim to increase the difficulty for the attacker in conducting attacks by regularly changing certain elements of the defense, such as cycling through configurations. To examine these claims, we study for the first time the effectiveness of several recent MTDs for adversarial ML attacks applied to the malware detection domain. Under different threat models, we show that transferability and query attack strategies can achieve high levels of evasion against these defenses through existing and novel attack strategies across Android and Windows. We also show that fingerprinting and reconnaissance are possible and demonstrate how attackers may obtain critical defense hyperparameters as well as information about how predictions are produced. Based on our findings, we present key recommendations for future work on the development of effective MTDs for adversarial attacks in ML-based malware detection.

- `2206.12447v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12447v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12447v2)

> Hardware-based Malware Detectors (HMDs) have shown promise in detecting malicious workloads. However, the current HMDs focus solely on the CPU core of a System-on-Chip (SoC) and, therefore, do not exploit the full potential of the hardware telemetry. In this paper, we propose XMD, an HMD that uses an expansive set of telemetry channels extracted from the different subsystems of SoC. XMD exploits the thread-level profiling power of the CPU-core telemetry, and the global profiling power of non-core telemetry channels, to achieve significantly better detection performance than currently used Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) based detectors. We leverage the concept of manifold hypothesis to analytically prove the performance gains observed in XMD. We train and evaluate XMD using hardware telemetries collected from 904 benign applications and 1205 malware samples on a commodity Android Operating System (OS)-based mobile device. XMD improves over currently used HPC-based detectors by 32.91% for the in-distribution test data. XMD achieves the best detection performance of 86.54% with a false positive rate of 2.9%, compared to the detection rate of 80\%, offered by the best performing software-based Anti-Virus(AV) on VirusTotal, on the same set of malware samples.

> Recent works have introduced input-convex neural networks (ICNNs) as learning models with advantageous training, inference, and generalization properties linked to their convex structure. In this paper, we propose a novel feature-convex neural network architecture as the composition of an ICNN with a Lipschitz feature map in order to achieve adversarial robustness. We consider the asymmetric binary classification setting with one "sensitive" class, and for this class we prove deterministic, closed-form, and easily-computable certified robust radii for arbitrary $\ell_p$-norms. We theoretically justify the use of these models by characterizing their decision region geometry, extending the universal approximation theorem for ICNN regression to the classification setting, and proving a lower bound on the probability that such models perfectly fit even unstructured uniformly distributed data in sufficiently high dimensions. Experiments on Malimg malware classification and subsets of MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets show that feature-convex classifiers attain state-of-the-art certified $\ell_1$-radii as well as substantial $\ell_2$- and $\ell_{\infty}$-radii while being far more computationally efficient than any competitive baseline.

> Machine learning methods can detect Android malware with very high accuracy. However, these classifiers have an Achilles heel, concept drift: they rapidly become out of date and ineffective, due to the evolution of malware apps and benign apps. Our research finds that, after training an Android malware classifier on one year's worth of data, the F1 score quickly dropped from 0.99 to 0.76 after 6 months of deployment on new test samples.   In this paper, we propose new methods to combat the concept drift problem of Android malware classifiers. Since machine learning technique needs to be continuously deployed, we use active learning: we select new samples for analysts to label, and then add the labeled samples to the training set to retrain the classifier. Our key idea is, similarity-based uncertainty is more robust against concept drift. Therefore, we combine contrastive learning with active learning. We propose a new hierarchical contrastive learning scheme, and a new sample selection technique to continuously train the Android malware classifier. Our evaluation shows that this leads to significant improvements, compared to previously published methods for active learning. Our approach reduces the false negative rate from 16% (for the best baseline) to 10%, while maintaining the same false positive rate (0.6%). Also, our approach maintains more consistent performance across a seven-year time period than past methods.

> Due to the completely open-source nature of Android, the exploitable vulnerability of malware attacks is increasing. Machine learning, leading to a great evolution in Android malware detection in recent years, is typically applied in the classification phase. Since the correlation between features is ignored in some traditional ranking-based feature selection algorithms, applying wrapper-based feature selection models is a topic worth investigating. Though considering the correlation between features, wrapper-based approaches are time-consuming for exploring all possible valid feature subsets when processing a large number of Android features. To reduce the computational expense of wrapper-based feature selection, a framework named DroidRL is proposed. The framework deploys DDQN algorithm to obtain a subset of features which can be used for effective malware classification. To select a valid subset of features over a larger range, the exploration-exploitation policy is applied in the model training phase. The recurrent neural network (RNN) is used as the decision network of DDQN to give the framework the ability to sequentially select features. Word embedding is applied for feature representation to enhance the framework's ability to find the semantic relevance of features. The framework's feature selection exhibits high performance without any human intervention and can be ported to other feature selection tasks with minor changes. The experiment results show a significant effect when using the Random Forest as DroidRL's classifier, which reaches 95.6% accuracy with only 24 features selected.

> Concerns for the resilience of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in critical infrastructure are growing. CPS integrate sensing, computation, control and networking into physical objects and mission-critical services, connecting traditional infrastructure to internet technologies. While this integration increases service efficiency, it has to face the possibility of new threats posed by the new functionalities. This leads to cyber-threats, such as denial-of-service, modification of data, information leakage, spreading of malware, and many others. Cyber-resilience refers to the ability of a CPS to prepare, absorb, recover, and adapt to the adverse effects associated with cyber-threats, e.g., physical degradation of the CPS performance resulting from a cyber-attack. Cyber-resilience aims at ensuring CPS survival, by keeping the core functionalities of the CPS in case of extreme events. The literature on cyber-resilience is rapidly increasing, leading to a broad variety of research works addressing this new topic. In this article, we create a systematization of knowledge about existing scientific efforts of making CPS cyber-resilient. We systematically survey recent literature addressing cyber-resilience with a focus on techniques that may be used on CPS. We first provide preliminaries and background on CPS and threats, and subsequently survey state-of-the-art approaches that have been proposed by recent research work applicable to CPS. In particular, we aim at differentiating research work from traditional risk management approaches, based on the general acceptance that it is unfeasible to prevent and mitigate all possible risks threatening a CPS. We also discuss questions and research challenges, with a focus on the practical aspects of cyber-resilience, such as the use of metrics and evaluation methods, as well as testing and validation environments.

Malware has the capability of corrupting a device and collapsing an entire network. Therefore, its early detection and mitigation are extremely important to avoid catastrophic effects. In this work, we came up with a solution for malware detection using state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Our main focus is to provide a lightweight yet effective classifier for malware detection which can be used for heterogeneous devices, be it a resource constraint device or a resourceful machine. Our proposed model is tested on the benchmark data set with an accuracy and log loss score of 99.13 percent and 0.04 respectively.

> Malware has been one of the most damaging threats to computers that span across multiple operating systems and various file formats. To defend against ever-increasing and ever-evolving malware, tremendous efforts have been made to propose a variety of malware detection that attempt to effectively and efficiently detect malware so as to mitigate possible damages as early as possible. Recent studies have shown that, on the one hand, existing ML and DL techniques enable superior solutions in detecting newly emerging and previously unseen malware. However, on the other hand, ML and DL models are inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of adversarial examples. In this paper, we focus on malware with the file format of portable executable (PE) in the family of Windows operating systems, namely Windows PE malware, as a representative case to study the adversarial attack methods in such adversarial settings. To be specific, we start by first outlining the general learning framework of Windows PE malware detection based on ML/DL and subsequently highlighting three unique challenges of performing adversarial attacks in the context of Windows PE malware. Then, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic review to categorize the state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against PE malware detection, as well as corresponding defenses to increase the robustness of Windows PE malware detection.

> Be it for a malicious or legitimate purpose, packing, a transformation that consists in applying various operations like compression or encryption to a binary file, i.e. for making reverse engineering harder or obfuscating code, is widely employed since decades already. Particularly in the field of malware analysis where a stumbling block is evasion, it has proven effective and still gives a hard time to scientists who want to efficiently detect it. While already extensively covered in the scientific literature, it remains an open issue especially when considering its detection time and accuracy trade-off. Many approaches, including machine learning, have been proposed but most studies often restrict their scope (i.e. malware and PE files), rely on uncertain datasets (i.e. built based on a super-detector or using labels from an questionable source) and do no provide any open implementation, which makes comparing state-of-the-art solutions tedious. Considering the many challenges that packing implies, there exists room for improvement in the way it is addressed, especially when dealing with static detection techniques. In order to tackle with these challenges, we propose an experimental toolkit, aptly called the Packing Box, leveraging automation and containerization in an open source platform that brings a unified solution to the research community and we showcase it with some experiments including unbiased ground truth generation, data visualization, machine learning pipeline automation and performance of open source packing static detectors.

> With the increase in cybersecurity vulnerabilities of software systems, the ways to exploit them are also increasing. Besides these, malware threats, irregular network interactions, and discussions about exploits in public forums are also on the rise. To identify these threats faster, to detect potentially relevant entities from any texts, and to be aware of software vulnerabilities, automated approaches are necessary. Application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in the Cybersecurity domain can help in achieving this. However, there are challenges such as the diverse nature of texts involved in the cybersecurity domain, the unavailability of large-scale publicly available datasets, and the significant cost of hiring subject matter experts for annotations. One of the solutions is building multi-task models that can be trained jointly with limited data. In this work, we introduce a generative multi-task model, Unified Text-to-Text Cybersecurity (UTS), trained on malware reports, phishing site URLs, programming code constructs, social media data, blogs, news articles, and public forum posts. We show UTS improves the performance of some cybersecurity datasets. We also show that with a few examples, UTS can be adapted to novel unseen tasks and the nature of data

> ML models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial query attacks. In these attacks, queries are iteratively perturbed towards a particular class without any knowledge of the target model besides its output. The prevalence of remotely-hosted ML classification models and Machine-Learning-as-a-Service platforms means that query attacks pose a real threat to the security of these systems. To deal with this, stateful defenses have been proposed to detect query attacks and prevent the generation of adversarial examples by monitoring and analyzing the sequence of queries received by the system. Several stateful defenses have been proposed in recent years. However, these defenses rely solely on similarity or out-of-distribution detection methods that may be effective in other domains. In the malware detection domain, the methods to generate adversarial examples are inherently different, and therefore we find that such detection mechanisms are significantly less effective. Hence, in this paper, we present MalProtect, which is a stateful defense against query attacks in the malware detection domain. MalProtect uses several threat indicators to detect attacks. Our results show that it reduces the evasion rate of adversarial query attacks by 80+\% in Android and Windows malware, across a range of attacker scenarios. In the first evaluation of its kind, we show that MalProtect outperforms prior stateful defenses, especially under the peak adversarial threat.

> Machine Learning (ML) techniques facilitate automating malicious software (malware for short) detection, but suffer from evasion attacks. Many researchers counter such attacks in heuristic manners short of both theoretical guarantees and defense effectiveness. We hence propose a new adversarial training framework, termed Principled Adversarial Malware Detection (PAD), which encourages convergence guarantees for robust optimization methods. PAD lays on a learnable convex measurement that quantifies distribution-wise discrete perturbations and protects the malware detector from adversaries, by which for smooth detectors, adversarial training can be performed heuristically with theoretical treatments. To promote defense effectiveness, we propose a new mixture of attacks to instantiate PAD for enhancing the deep neural network-based measurement and malware detector. Experimental results on two Android malware datasets demonstrate: (i) the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses; (ii) it can harden the ML-based malware detection against 27 evasion attacks with detection accuracies greater than 83.45%, while suffering an accuracy decrease smaller than 2.16% in the absence of attacks; (iii) it matches or outperforms many anti-malware scanners in VirusTotal service against realistic adversarial malware.

Traditional signature-based methods of malware detection have limitations in detecting complex and evolving threats. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution to detect malware effectively. ML algorithms are capable of analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns that are difficult for humans to identify. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art ML techniques used in malware detection, including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. We also examine the challenges and limitations of ML-based malware detection, such as the potential for adversarial attacks and the need for large amounts of labeled data. Furthermore, we discuss future directions in ML-based malware detection, including the integration of multiple ML algorithms and the use of explainable AI techniques to enhance the interpret ability of ML-based detection systems.

> Moving Target Defense and Cyber Deception emerged in recent years as two key proactive cyber defense approaches, contrasting with the static nature of the traditional reactive cyber defense. The key insight behind these approaches is to impose an asymmetric disadvantage for the attacker by using deception and randomization techniques to create a dynamic attack surface. Moving Target Defense typically relies on system randomization and diversification, while Cyber Deception is based on decoy nodes and fake systems to deceive attackers. However, current Moving Target Defense techniques are complex to manage and can introduce high overheads, while Cyber Deception nodes are easily recognized and avoided by adversaries.   This paper presents DOLOS, a novel architecture that unifies Cyber Deception and Moving Target Defense approaches. DOLOS is motivated by the insight that deceptive techniques are much more powerful when integrated into production systems rather than deployed alongside them. DOLOS combines typical Moving Target Defense techniques, such as randomization, diversity, and redundancy, with cyber deception and seamlessly integrates them into production systems through multiple layers of isolation. We extensively evaluate DOLOS against a wide range of attackers, ranging from automated malware to professional penetration testers, and show that DOLOS is highly effective in slowing down attacks and protecting the integrity of production systems. We also provide valuable insights and considerations for the future development of MTD techniques based on our findings.

> Deep learning (DL) has proven to be effective in detecting sophisticated malware that is constantly evolving. Even though deep learning has alleviated the feature engineering problem, finding the most optimal DL model, in terms of neural architecture search (NAS) and the model's optimal set of hyper-parameters, remains a challenge that requires domain expertise. In addition, many of the proposed state-of-the-art models are very complex and may not be the best fit for different datasets. A promising approach, known as Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), can reduce the domain expertise required to implement a custom DL model. AutoML reduces the amount of human trial-and-error involved in designing DL models, and in more recent implementations can find new model architectures with relatively low computational overhead.   This work provides a comprehensive analysis and insights on using AutoML for static and online malware detection. For static, our analysis is performed on two widely used malware datasets: SOREL-20M to demonstrate efficacy on large datasets; and EMBER-2018, a smaller dataset specifically curated to hinder the performance of machine learning models. In addition, we show the effects of tuning the NAS process parameters on finding a more optimal malware detection model on these static analysis datasets. Further, we also demonstrate that AutoML is performant in online malware detection scenarios using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for cloud IaaS. We compare an AutoML technique to six existing state-of-the-art CNNs using a newly generated online malware dataset with and without other applications running in the background during malware execution.In general, our experimental results show that the performance of AutoML based static and online malware detection models are on par or even better than state-of-the-art models or hand-designed models presented in literature.

> As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow, smartphones have become an integral part of IoT systems. However, with the increasing amount of personal information stored on smartphones, users' privacy is at risk of being compromised by malicious attackers. Malware detection engines are commonly installed on smartphones to defend against these attacks, but new attacks that can evade these defenses may still emerge. In this paper, we present EavesDroid, a new side-channel attack on Android smartphones that allows an unprivileged attacker to accurately infer fine-grained user behaviors (e.g. viewing messages, playing videos) through the on-screen operations. Our attack relies on the correlation between user behaviors and the return values of system calls. The fact that these return values are affected by many factors, resulting in fluctuation and misalignment, makes the attack more challenging. Therefore, we build a CNN-GRU classification model, apply min-max normalization to the raw data and combine multiple features to identify the fine-grained user behaviors. A series of experiments on different models and systems of Android smartphones show that, EavesDroid can achieve an accuracy of 98% and 86% for already considered user behaviors in test set and real-world settings. To prevent this attack, we recommend malware detection, obfuscating return values or restricting applications from reading vulnerable return values.

> Popular messaging applications now enable end-to-end-encryption (E2EE) by default, and E2EE data storage is becoming common. These important advances for security and privacy create new content moderation challenges for online services, because services can no longer directly access plaintext content. While ongoing public policy debates about E2EE and content moderation in the United States and European Union emphasize child sexual abuse material and misinformation in messaging and storage, we identify and synthesize a wealth of scholarship that goes far beyond those topics. We bridge literature that is diverse in both content moderation subject matter, such as malware, spam, hate speech, terrorist content, and enterprise policy compliance, as well as intended deployments, including not only privacy-preserving content moderation for messaging, email, and cloud storage, but also private introspection of encrypted web traffic by middleboxes. In this work, we systematize the study of content moderation in E2EE settings. We set out a process pipeline for content moderation, drawing on a broad interdisciplinary literature that is not specific to E2EE. We examine cryptography and policy design choices at all stages of this pipeline, and we suggest areas of future research to fill gaps in literature and better understand possible paths forward.

> Blockchain has recently been depicted as a secure protocol for information exchange in cyber-physical microgrids. However, it is still found vulnerable to consensus manipulation attacks. These stealth attacks are often difficult to detect as they use kernel-level access to mask their actions. In this paper, we firstly build a trusted and secured peer-to-peer network mechanism for physical DC microgrids' validation of transactions over Distributed Ledger. Secondly, we leverage from a physics-informed approach for detecting malware-infected nodes and then recovering from stealth attacks using a self-healing recovery scheme augmented into the microgrid Blockchain network. This scheme allows compromised nodes to adapt to a reconstructed trustworthy signal in a multi-hop manner using corresponding measurements from the reliable nodes in the network. Additionally, recognizing the possible threat of denial-of-service attacks and random time delays (where information sharing via communication channels is blocked), we also integrate a model-free predictive controller with the proposed system that can locally reconstruct an expected version of the attacked/delayed signals. This supplements the capabilities of Blockchain, enabling it to detect and mitigate consensus manipulation attempts, and network latencies.
