<summary>2015-01-09 07:58:08 - New Hashing Algorithm for Use in TCP Reassembly Module of IPS</summary>

- *Sankalp Bagaria*

- `1501.02062v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02062v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.02062v1)

> Since last decade, IDS/ IPS has gained popularity in protecting large networks. They can employ signature based techniques and/or flow-based techniques to prevent intrusion from outside/ inside the network they are trying to protect. Signature based IDS/ IPS can be stateless or stateful. Stateful IDS can store the state of the protocol and use it for better detection of malware. In the case of TCP/IP networks, an attacker can also launch an attack such that the malicious code is distributed over many packets. These packets pass through the traditional IDS/ IPS and reassemble inside the network. Once re-assembled inside the network by the TCP/IP layer, the malicious code launches an attack.   The TCP state and a copy of last few packets for each active connection has to be maintained in IDS/IPS. In TCP re-assembly, packets are re-assembled at IDS/IPS and searched for signature matches. A connection table has to be maintained for active connections and their list of last few (atmost 11) packets that have already arrived. We need data structures for searching the connection that the latest incoming packet belongs to. Popular hashing algorithms like CRC, XOR, summing tuple, taking modulus are inefficient as hash keys are not evenly distributed in hash-key space. Thus we show how an algorithm based on cryptography concepts can be used for efficient hashing in network connection management. We also show how to use full four tuple for calculating hash key instead of simply summing the tuple and taking the modulus of the sum.

- `1410.8317v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8317v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8317v2)

> The alarming rise in the quantity of malware in the last few years poses a serious challenge to the security community and requires urgent response. However, current countermeasures seem to be no longer effective. Thus, it is our belief that it is now time for researchers and security experts to turn to nature in the search for novel inspirations for defense systems. Nature has provided species with a whole range of offensive and defensive techniques, which have been developing and improving in the course of billions of years of evolution. The extremely diverse living conditions have promoted a large variation in the devised bio-security solutions. In this paper we introduce a novel PROTECTION framework in which common denominators of the encountered offensive and defensive means are proposed and presented. The bio-inspired solutions are discussed in the context of cybersecurity, where some principles have already been adopted. The deployment of the whole nature-based framework should aid the design and improvement process of modern cyber-defense systems.

<summary>2015-02-12 16:59:07 - Robust and Effective Malware Detection through Quantitative Data Flow Graph Metrics</summary>

- *Tobias Wüchner, Martín Ochoa, Alexander Pretschner*

- `1502.01609v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01609v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01609v2)

> We present a novel malware detection approach based on metrics over quantitative data flow graphs. Quantitative data flow graphs (QDFGs) model process behavior by interpreting issued system calls as aggregations of quantifiable data flows.Due to the high abstraction level we consider QDFG metric based detection more robust against typical behavior obfuscation like bogus call injection or call reordering than other common behavioral models that base on raw system calls. We support this claim with experiments on obfuscated malware logs and demonstrate the superior obfuscation robustness in comparison to detection using n-grams. Our evaluations on a large and diverse data set consisting of about 7000 malware and 500 goodware samples show an average detection rate of 98.01% and a false positive rate of 0.48%. Moreover, we show that our approach is able to detect new malware (i.e. samples from malware families not included in the training set) and that the consideration of quantities in itself significantly improves detection precision.

- *Sebastian Banescu, Tobias Wüchner, Marius Guggenmos, Martín Ochoa, Alexander Pretschner*

- `1502.03245v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03245v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03245v2)

> Program obfuscation is increasingly popular among malware creators. Objectively comparing different malware detection approaches with respect to their resilience against obfuscation is challenging. To the best of our knowledge, there is no common empirical framework for evaluating the resilience of malware detection approaches w.r.t. behavior obfuscation. We propose and implement such a framework that obfuscates the observable behavior of malware binaries. To assess the framework's utility, we use it to obfuscate known malware binaries and then investigate the impact on detection effectiveness of different $n$-gram based detection approaches. We find that the obfuscation transformations employed by our framework significantly affect the precision of such detection approaches. Several $n$-gram-based approaches can hence be concluded not to be resilient against this simple kind of obfuscation.

<summary>2015-02-26 18:21:07 - Detecting Malware with Information Complexity</summary>

- *Nadia Alshahwan, Earl T. Barr, David Clark, George Danezis*

- `1502.07661v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07661v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.07661v1)

> This work focuses on a specific front of the malware detection arms-race, namely the detection of persistent, disk-resident malware. We exploit normalised compression distance (NCD), an information theoretic measure, applied directly to binaries. Given a zoo of labelled malware and benign-ware, we ask whether a suspect program is more similar to our malware or to our benign-ware. Our approach classifies malware with 97.1% accuracy and a false positive rate of 3%. We achieve our results with off-the-shelf compressors and a standard machine learning classifier and without any specialised knowledge. An end-user need only collect a zoo of malware and benign-ware and then can immediately apply our techniques.   We apply statistical rigour to our experiments and our selection of data. We demonstrate that accuracy can be optimised by combining NCD with the compressibility rates of the executables. We demonstrate that malware reported within a more narrow time frame of a few days is more homogenous than malware reported over a longer one of two years but that our method still classifies the latter with 95.2% accuracy and a 5% false positive rate. Due to the use of compression, the time and computation cost of our method is non-trivial. We show that simple approximation techniques can improve the time complexity of our approach by up to 63%.   We compare our results to the results of applying the 59 anti-malware programs used on the VirusTotal web site to our malware. Our approach does better than any single one of them as well as the 59 used collectively.

<summary>2015-03-04 01:18:42 - Automated detection and classification of cryptographic algorithms in binary programs through machine learning</summary>

- *Diane Duros Hosfelt*

- `1503.01186v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01186v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.01186v1)

> Threats from the internet, particularly malicious software (i.e., malware) often use cryptographic algorithms to disguise their actions and even to take control of a victim's system (as in the case of ransomware). Malware and other threats proliferate too quickly for the time-consuming traditional methods of binary analysis to be effective. By automating detection and classification of cryptographic algorithms, we can speed program analysis and more efficiently combat malware.   This thesis will present several methods of leveraging machine learning to automatically discover and classify cryptographic algorithms in compiled binary programs.   While further work is necessary to fully evaluate these methods on real-world binary programs, the results in this paper suggest that machine learning can be used successfully to detect and identify cryptographic primitives in compiled code. Currently, these techniques successfully detect and classify cryptographic algorithms in small single-purpose programs, and further work is proposed to apply them to real-world examples.

<summary>2015-04-07 18:09:11 - Security Toolbox for Detecting Novel and Sophisticated Android Malware</summary>

- *Benjamin Holland, Tom Deering, Suresh Kothari, Jon Mathews, Nikhil Ranade*

- `1504.01693v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01693v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.01693v1)

> This paper presents a demo of our Security Toolbox to detect novel malware in Android apps. This Toolbox is developed through our recent research project funded by the DARPA Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) project. The adversarial challenge ("Red") teams in the DARPA APAC program are tasked with designing sophisticated malware to test the bounds of malware detection technology being developed by the research and development ("Blue") teams. Our research group, a Blue team in the DARPA APAC program, proposed a "human-in-the-loop program analysis" approach to detect malware given the source or Java bytecode for an Android app. Our malware detection apparatus consists of two components: a general-purpose program analysis platform called Atlas, and a Security Toolbox built on the Atlas platform. This paper describes the major design goals, the Toolbox components to achieve the goals, and the workflow for auditing Android apps. The accompanying video (http://youtu.be/WhcoAX3HiNU) illustrates features of the Toolbox through a live audit.

<summary>2015-04-26 23:26:27 - Two Trends in Mobile Security: Financial Motives and Transitioning from Static to Dynamic Analysis</summary>

- *Emre Erturk*

- `1504.06893v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06893v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.06893v1)

> The goal of this paper is to analyze the behavior and intent of recent types of privacy invasive Android adware. There are two recent trends in this area: more financial motives instead of ego motives, and the development of more dynamic analysis tools. This paper starts with a review of Android mobile operating system security, and also addresses the pros and cons of open source operating system security. Static analysis of malware provides high quality results and leads to a good understanding as shown in this paper. However, as malware grows in number and complexity, there have been recent efforts to automate the detection mechanisms and many of the static tasks. As Android's market share is rapidly growing around the world. Android security will be a crucial area of research for IT security professionals and their academic counterparts. The upside of the current situation is that malware is being quickly exposed, thanks to open source software development tools. This cooperation is important in curbing the widespread theft of personal information with monetary value.

- `1504.06093v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06093v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.06093v2)

> There are over 1.2 million applications on the Google Play store today with a large number of competing applications for any given use or function. This creates challenges for users in selecting the right application. Moreover, some of the applications being of dubious origin, there are no mechanisms for users to understand who the applications are talking to, and to what extent. In our work, we first develop a lightweight characterization methodology that can automatically extract descriptions of application network behavior, and apply this to a large selection of applications from the Google App Store. We find several instances of overly aggressive communication with tracking websites, of excessive communication with ad related sites, and of communication with sites previously associated with malware activity. Our results underscore the need for a tool to provide users more visibility into the communication of apps installed on their mobile devices. To this end, we develop an Android application to do just this; our application monitors outgoing traffic, associates it with particular applications, and then identifies destinations in particular categories that we believe suspicious or else important to reveal to the end-user.

<summary>2015-05-13 11:09:52 - A general practitioner or a specialist for your infected smartphone?</summary>

- *Jelena Milosevic, Alberto Ferrante, Miroslaw Malek*

- `1505.03329v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03329v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03329v1)

> With explosive growth in the number of mobile devices, the mobile malware is rapidly spreading as well, and the number of encountered malware families is increasing. Existing solutions, which are mainly based on one malware detector running on the phone or in the cloud, are no longer effective. Main problem lies in the fact that it might be impossible to create a unique mobile malware detector that would be able to detect different malware families with high accuracy, being at the same time lightweight enough not to drain battery quickly and fast enough to give results of detection promptly. The proposed approach to mobile malware detection is analogous to general practitioner versus specialist approach to dealing with a medical problem. Similarly to a general practitioner that, based on indicative symptoms identifies potential illnesses and sends the patient to an appropriate specialist, our detection system distinguishes among symptoms representing different malware families and, once the symptoms are detected, it triggers specific analyses. A system monitoring application operates in the same way as a general practitioner. It is able to distinguish between different symptoms and trigger appropriate detection mechanisms. As an analogy to different specialists, an ensemble of detectors, each of which specifically trained for a particular malware family, is used. The main challenge of the approach is to define representative symptoms of different malware families and train detectors accordingly to them. The main goal of the poster is to foster discussion on the most representative symptoms of different malware families and to discuss initial results in this area obtained by using Malware Genome project dataset.

<summary>2015-05-26 07:50:43 - Unauthorized Cross-App Resource Access on MAC OS X and iOS</summary>

- *Luyi Xing, Xiaolong Bai, Tongxin Li, XiaoFeng Wang, Kai Chen, Xiaojing Liao, Shi-Min Hu, Xinhui Han*

- `1505.06836v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06836v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.06836v1)

> On modern operating systems, applications under the same user are separated from each other, for the purpose of protecting them against malware and compromised programs. Given the complexity of today's OSes, less clear is whether such isolation is effective against different kind of cross-app resource access attacks (called XARA in our research). To better understand the problem, on the less-studied Apple platforms, we conducted a systematic security analysis on MAC OS~X and iOS. Our research leads to the discovery of a series of high-impact security weaknesses, which enable a sandboxed malicious app, approved by the Apple Stores, to gain unauthorized access to other apps' sensitive data. More specifically, we found that the inter-app interaction services, including the keychain, WebSocket and NSConnection on OS~X and URL Scheme on the MAC OS and iOS, can all be exploited by the malware to steal such confidential information as the passwords for iCloud, email and bank, and the secret token of Evernote. Further, the design of the app sandbox on OS~X was found to be vulnerable, exposing an app's private directory to the sandboxed malware that hijacks its Apple Bundle ID. As a result, sensitive user data, like the notes and user contacts under Evernote and photos under WeChat, have all been disclosed. Fundamentally, these problems are caused by the lack of app-to-app and app-to-OS authentications. To better understand their impacts, we developed a scanner that automatically analyzes the binaries of MAC OS and iOS apps to determine whether proper protection is missing in their code. Running it on hundreds of binaries, we confirmed the pervasiveness of the weaknesses among high-impact Apple apps. Since the issues may not be easily fixed, we built a simple program that detects exploit attempts on OS~X, helping protect vulnerable apps before the problems can be fully addressed.

> The use of TLS proxies to intercept encrypted traffic is controversial since the same mechanism can be used for both benevolent purposes, such as protecting against malware, and for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or warrantless government surveillance. To understand the prevalence and uses of these proxies, we build a TLS proxy measurement tool and deploy it via Google AdWords campaigns. We generate 15.2 million certificate tests across two large-scale measurement studies. We find that 1 in 250 TLS connections are TLS-proxied. The majority of these proxies appear to be benevolent, however we identify over 3,600 cases where eight malware products are using this technology nefariously. We also find numerous instances of negligent, duplicitous, and suspicious behavior, some of which degrade security for users without their knowledge. Distinguishing these types of practices is challenging in practice, indicating a need for transparency and user awareness.

> This paper compares the risk factors for becoming a victim of two types of phishing: high-tech phishing (using malicious software) and low-tech phishing (using e-mails and telephone calls). These risk factors are linked to possibilities for situational crime prevention. Data from a cybercrime victim survey in the Netherlands (n=10,316) is used. Based on routine activity theory, the multivariate analyses include thirty variables. The findings show situational crime prevention has to be aimed at groups other than just the users themselves. Criminals are primarily interested in popular online places and the onus is on the owners of these virtual places to protect their visitors from getting infected.

> Volatile memory dump and its analysis is an essential part of digital forensics. Among a number of various software and hardware approaches for memory dumping there are authors who point out that some of these approaches are not resilient to various anti-forensic techniques, and others that require a reboot or are highly platform dependent. New resilient tools have certain disadvantages such as low speed or vulnerability to rootkits which directly manipulate kernel structures e.g. page tables. A new memory forensic system - Malware Analysis System for Hidden Knotty Anomalies (MASHKA) is described in this paper. It is resilient to popular anti-forensic techniques. The system can be used for doing a wide range of memory forensics tasks. This paper describes how to apply the system for research and detection of kernel mode rootkits and also presents analysis of the most popular anti-rootkit tools.

> Hardware virtualization technologies play a significant role in cyber security. On the one hand these technologies enhance security levels, by designing a trusted operating system. On the other hand these technologies can be taken up into modern malware which is rather hard to detect. None of the existing methods is able to efficiently detect a hypervisor in the face of countermeasures such as time cheating, temporary self uninstalling, memory hiding etc. New hypervisor detection methods which will be described in this paper can detect a hypervisor under these countermeasures and even count several nested ones. These novel approaches rely on the new statistical analysis of time discrepancies by examination of a set of instructions, which are unconditionally intercepted by a hypervisor. Reliability was achieved through the comprehensive analysis of the collected data despite its fluctuation. These offered methods were comprehensively assessed in both Intel and AMD CPUs.

- *Yvo Desmedt, Stelios Erotokritou*

- `1506.04429v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04429v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04429v1)

> Code voting was introduced by Chaum as a solution for using a possibly infected-by-malware device to cast a vote in an electronic voting application. Chaum's work on code voting assumed voting codes are physically delivered to voters using the mail system, implicitly requiring to trust the mail system. This is not necessarily a valid assumption to make - especially if the mail system cannot be trusted. When conspiring with the recipient of the cast ballots, privacy is broken.   It is clear to the public that when it comes to privacy, computers and "secure" communication over the Internet cannot fully be trusted. This emphasizes the importance of using: (1) Unconditional security for secure network communication. (2) Reduce reliance on untrusted computers.   In this paper we explore how to remove the mail system trust assumption in code voting. We use PSMT protocols (SCN 2012) where with the help of visual aids, humans can carry out $\mod 10$ addition correctly with a 99\% degree of accuracy. We introduce an unconditionally secure MIX based on the combinatorics of set systems.   Given that end users of our proposed voting scheme construction are humans we \emph{cannot use} classical Secure Multi Party Computation protocols.   Our solutions are for both single and multi-seat elections achieving: \begin{enumerate}[i)]   \item An anonymous and perfectly secure communication network secure against a $t$-bounded passive adversary used to deliver voting,   \item The end step of the protocol can be handled by a human to evade the threat of malware. \end{enumerate} We do not focus on active adversaries.

We then investigate the mechanics of malware command and control (C2) establishment: we provide a comprehensive review of the techniques used by attackers to set up such a channel and to hide its presence from the attacked parties and the security tools they use. We then switch to the defensive side of the problem, and review approaches that have been proposed for the detection and disruption of C2 channels. We also map such techniques to widely-adopted security controls, emphasizing gaps or limitations (and success stories) in current best practices.

> Identifying the tasks a given piece of malware was designed to perform (e.g. logging keystrokes, recording video, establishing remote access, etc.) is a difficult and time-consuming operation that is largely human-driven in practice. In this paper, we present an automated method to identify malware tasks. Using two different malware collections, we explore various circumstances for each - including cases where the training data differs significantly from test; where the malware being evaluated employs packing to thwart analytical techniques; and conditions with sparse training data. We find that this approach consistently out-performs the current state-of-the art software for malware task identification as well as standard machine learning approaches - often achieving an unbiased F1 score of over 0.9. In the near future, we look to deploy our approach for use by analysts in an operational cyber-security environment.

> The web is experiencing an explosive growth in the last years. New technologies are introduced at a very fast-pace with the aim of narrowing the gap between web-based applications and traditional desktop applications. The results are web applications that look and feel almost like desktop applications while retaining the advantages of being originated from the web. However, these advancements come at a price. The same technologies used to build responsive, pleasant and fully-featured web applications, can also be used to write web malware able to escape detection systems. In this article we present new obfuscation techniques, based on some of the features of the upcoming HTML5 standard, which can be used to deceive malware detection systems. The proposed techniques have been experimented on a reference set of obfuscated malware. Our results show that the malware rewritten using our obfuscation techniques go undetected while being analyzed by a large number of detection systems. The same detection systems were able to correctly identify the same malware in its original unobfuscated form. We also provide some hints about how the existing malware detection systems can be modified in order to cope with these new techniques.

> Cybercrime is increasing at a faster pace and sometimes causes billions of dollars of business- losses so investigating attackers after commitment is of utmost importance and become one of the main concerns of network managers. Network forensics as the process of Collecting, identifying, extracting and analyzing data and systematically monitoring traffic of network is one of the main requirements in detection and tracking of criminals. In this paper, we propose an architecture for network forensic system. Our proposed architecture consists of five main components: collection and indexing, database management, analysis component, SOC communication component and the database. The main difference between our proposed architecture and other systems is in analysis component. This component is composed of four parts: Analysis and investigation subsystem, Reporting subsystem, Alert and visualization subsystem and the malware analysis subsystem. The most important differentiating factors of the proposed system with existing systems are: clustering and ranking of malware, dynamic analysis of malware, collecting and analysis of network flows and anomalous behaviour analysis.

> As antivirus and network intrusion detection systems have increasingly proven insufficient to detect advanced threats, large security operations centers have moved to deploy endpoint-based sensors that provide deeper visibility into low-level events across their enterprises. Unfortunately, for many organizations in government and industry, the installation, maintenance, and resource requirements of these newer solutions pose barriers to adoption and are perceived as risks to organizations' missions.   To mitigate this problem we investigated the utility of agentless detection of malicious endpoint behavior, using only the standard build-in Windows audit logging facility as our signal. We found that Windows audit logs, while emitting manageable sized data streams on the endpoints, provide enough information to allow robust detection of malicious behavior. Audit logs provide an effective, low-cost alternative to deploying additional expensive agent-based breach detection systems in many government and industrial settings, and can be used to detect, in our tests, 83% percent of malware samples with a 0.1% false positive rate. They can also supplement already existing host signature-based antivirus solutions, like Kaspersky, Symantec, and McAfee, detecting, in our testing environment, 78% of malware missed by those antivirus systems.

> Computers are widely used today by most people. Internet based applications, like ecommerce or ebanking attracts criminals, who using sophisticated techniques, tries to introduce malware on the victim computer. But not only computer users are in risk, also smartphones or smartwatch users, smart cities, Internet of Things devices, etc. Different techniques has been tested against malware. Currently, pattern matching is the default approach in antivirus software. Also, Machine Learning is successfully being used. Continuing this trend, in this article we propose an anomaly based method using the hardware performance counters (HPC) available in almost any modern computer architecture. Because anomaly detection is an unsupervised process, new malware and APTs can be detected even if they are unknown.

> Spear phishing is a widespread concern in the modern network security landscape, but there are few metrics that measure the extent to which reconnaissance is performed on phishing targets. Spear phishing emails closely match the expectations of the recipient, based on details of their experiences and interests, making them a popular propagation vector for harmful malware. In this work we use Natural Language Processing techniques to investigate a specific real-world phishing campaign and quantify attributes that indicate a targeted spear phishing attack. Our phishing campaign data sample comprises 596 emails - all containing a web bug and a Curriculum Vitae (CV) PDF attachment - sent to our institution by a foreign IP space. The campaign was found to exclusively target specific demographics within our institution. Performing a semantic similarity analysis between the senders' CV attachments and the recipients' LinkedIn profiles, we conclude with high statistical certainty (p $< 10^{-4}$) that the attachments contain targeted rather than randomly selected material. Latent Semantic Analysis further demonstrates that individuals who were a primary focus of the campaign received CVs that are highly topically clustered. These findings differentiate this campaign from one that leverages random spam.

> Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) is a popular tool that uses compression algorithms to cluster and classify data in a wide range of applications. Existing discussions of NCD's theoretical merit rely on certain theoretical properties of compression algorithms. However, we demonstrate that many popular compression algorithms don't seem to satisfy these theoretical properties. We explore the relationship between some of these properties and file size, demonstrating that this theoretical problem is actually a practical problem for classifying malware with large file sizes, and we then introduce some variants of NCD that mitigate this problem.

> Malware remains a serious problem for corporations, government agencies, and individuals, as attackers continue to use it as a tool to effect frequent and costly network intrusions. Machine learning holds the promise of automating the work required to detect newly discovered malware families, and could potentially learn generalizations about malware and benign software that support the detection of entirely new, unknown malware families. Unfortunately, few proposed machine learning based malware detection methods have achieved the low false positive rates required to deliver deployable detectors.   In this paper we a deep neural network malware classifier that achieves a usable detection rate at an extremely low false positive rate and scales to real world training example volumes on commodity hardware. Specifically, we show that our system achieves a 95% detection rate at 0.1% false positive rate (FPR), based on more than 400,000 software binaries sourced directly from our customers and internal malware databases. We achieve these results by directly learning on all binaries, without any filtering, unpacking, or manually separating binary files into categories. Further, we confirm our false positive rates directly on a live stream of files coming in from Invincea's deployed endpoint solution, provide an estimate of how many new binary files we expected to see a day on an enterprise network, and describe how that relates to the false positive rate and translates into an intuitive threat score.   Our results demonstrate that it is now feasible to quickly train and deploy a low resource, highly accurate machine learning classification model, with false positive rates that approach traditional labor intensive signature based methods, while also detecting previously unseen malware.

- *Kai Zhu, Lei Ying*

- `1510.01814v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01814v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.01814v1)

> Information diffusion in networks can be used to model many real-world phenomena, including rumor spreading on online social networks, epidemics in human beings, and malware on the Internet. Informally speaking, the source localization problem is to identify a node in the network that provides the best explanation of the observed diffusion. Despite significant efforts and successes over last few years, theoretical guarantees of source localization algorithms were established only for tree networks due to the complexity of the problem. This paper presents a new source localization algorithm, called the Short-Fat Tree (SFT) algorithm. Loosely speaking, the algorithm selects the node such that the breadth-first search (BFS) tree from the node has the minimum depth but the maximum number of leaf nodes. Performance guarantees of SFT under the independent cascade (IC) model are established for both tree networks and the Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graph. On tree networks, SFT is the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimator. On the ER random graph, the following fundamental limits have been obtained: $(i)$ when the infection duration $<\frac{2}{3}t_u,$ SFT identifies the source with probability one asymptotically, where $t_u=\left\lceil\frac{\log n}{\log \mu}\right\rceil+2$ and $\mu$ is the average node degree, $(ii)$ when the infection duration $>t_u,$ the probability of identifying the source approaches zero asymptotically under any algorithm; and $(iii)$ when infection duration $<t_u,$ the BFS tree starting from the source is a fat tree. Numerical experiments on tree networks, the ER random graphs and real world networks with different evaluation metrics show that the SFT algorithm outperforms existing algorithms.

> Recent research shows that colluded malware in different VMs sharing a single physical host may use a resource as a channel to leak critical information. Covert channels employ time or storage characteristics to transmit confidential information to attackers leaving no trail.These channels were not meant for communication and hence control mechanisms do not exist. This means these remain undetected by traditional security measures employed in firewalls etc in a network. The comprehensive survey to address the issue highlights that accurate methods for fast detection in cloud are very expensive in terms of storage and processing. The proposed framework builds signature by extracting features which accurately classify the regular from covert traffic in cloud and estimates difference in distribution of data under analysis by means of scores. It then adds context to the signature and finally using machine learning (Support Vector Machines),a model is built and trained for deploying in cloud. The results show that the framework proposed is high in accuracy while being low cost and robust as it is tested after adding noise which is likely to exist in public cloud environments.

> The packaging model of Android apps requires the entire code necessary for the execution of an app to be shipped into one single apk file. Thus, an analysis of Android apps often visits code which is not part of the functionality delivered by the app. Such code is often contributed by the common libraries which are used pervasively by all apps. Unfortunately, Android analyses, e.g., for piggybacking detection and malware detection, can produce inaccurate results if they do not take into account the case of library code, which constitute noise in app features. Despite some efforts on investigating Android libraries, the momentum of Android research has not yet produced a complete set of common libraries to further support in-depth analysis of Android apps. In this paper, we leverage a dataset of about 1.5 million apps from Google Play to harvest potential common libraries, including advertisement libraries. With several steps of refinements, we finally collect by far the largest set of 1,113 libraries supporting common functionalities and 240 libraries for advertisement. We use the dataset to investigates several aspects of Android libraries, including their popularity and their proportion in Android app code. Based on these datasets, we have further performed several empirical investigations to confirm the motivations behind our work.

> Malwares are big threat to digital world and evolving with high complexity. It can penetrate networks, steal confidential information from computers, bring down servers and can cripple infrastructures etc. To combat the threat/attacks from the malwares, anti- malwares have been developed. The existing anti-malwares are mostly based on the assumption that the malware structure does not changes appreciably. But the recent advancement in second generation malwares can create variants and hence posed a challenge to anti-malwares developers. To combat the threat/attacks from the second generation malwares with low false alarm we present our survey on malwares and its detection techniques.

> Smartphones and tablets have become prime targets for malware, due to the valuable private and corporate information they hold. While Anti-Virus (AV) program may successfully detect malicious applications (apps), they remain ineffective against low-level rootkits that evade detection mechanisms by masking their own presence. Furthermore, any detection mechanism run on the same physical device as the monitored OS can be compromised via application, kernel or boot-loader vulnerabilities. Consequentially, trusted detection of kernel rootkits in mobile devices is a challenging task in practice. In this paper we present JoKER - a system which aims at detecting rootkits in the Android kernel by utilizing the hardware's Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) interface for trusted memory forensics. Our framework consists of components that extract areas of a kernel's memory and reconstruct it for further analysis. We present the overall architecture along with its implementation, and demonstrate that the system can successfully detect the presence of stealthy rootkits in the kernel. The results show that although JTAG's main purpose is system testing, it can also be used for malware detection where traditional methods fail.

> The emergence of mobile platforms with increased storage and computing capabilities and the pervasive use of these platforms for sensitive applications such as online banking, e-commerce and the storage of sensitive information on these mobile devices have led to increasing danger associated with malware targeted at these devices. Detecting such malware presents inimitable challenges as signature-based detection techniques available today are becoming inefficient in detecting new and unknown malware. In this research, a machine learning approach for the detection of malware on Android platforms is presented. The detection system monitors and extracts features from the applications while in execution and uses them to perform in-device detection using a trained K-Nearest Neighbour classifier. Results shows high performance in the detection rate of the classifier with accuracy of 93.75%, low error rate of 6.25% and low false positive rate with ability of detecting real Android malware.

> Over the last two decades, the scale and complexity of the Internet and its associated technologies built on the World Wide Web has grown exponentially with access to Internet as a facility occupying a prime place with other amenities of modern lives. In years to come, usage of Internet may unravel more pleasant surprises for us as far as novelty in its usage is concerned. As a democratic function of Internet, and relying on the open model on which it has been built, there has been concerted efforts in the direction of privacy protection and use of privacy enhancing tools which have gained tangible traction. Innovation in use of VPN, TLS/SSL and cryptographic tools are a testimony to it. Another popular tool is Tor, which has gained widespread popularity as it is being increasingly used by anonymity seeking users to effectively maintain their discretion while surfing the web.   However, there is a darker side to increased proliferation of Internet in our everyday routine. We are certainly not living in a utopian age and there are potentials of misuse of Internet as well. Across every nook and cranny of Internet's sprawling virtual world, there are cyber criminals lurking n dangerous alleys to use the very same Internet as malevolent tool to abuse it and cause financial, physical and social harm to ordinary people. Failing to manage the widespread spawning of World Wide Web has rendered it weak against misuse. In last few decades especially, Internet has been inundated with malware, ransomware, viruses, Trojans, illegal spy tools and what not created with malignant sentiments. In this paper, we will analyze few of the subverting privacy infrastructures.
